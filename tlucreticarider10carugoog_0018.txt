preponderate occasionally, or normally, which accounts for dit-
ferent states of mind and different temperaments (ll. 258—322).

(vi) The soul is most closely related to the body: in fact,
neither can exist without the other (ll. 32 3—349).

(vii) The bodily organs have sensation in themselves: eg.
the eyes themselves see and are not merely windows through
which the soul looks forth (ll. 350-369).

(viii) The atoms of soul are fewer than the atoms ot' body:
hence atoms of the body may be touched without atoms of the
soul perceiving it (ll. 370-395).

(ix) The animus is of more importance to life than the
anima: a good deal of the latter may be lost without death
following, but the least injury to the animus is fatal (ll. 396—416).

ln the doctrine thus laid down, there are two points which
are difficult and obscure: first, the division of the soul into two
parts ; secondly, the operation of the fourth nameless substance.
lt will be most convenient to consider these two points together.

Animus and Anima: Quarta Natura.

ln his extant account of the s0u11, which is only a brief
summary, Epicurus says nothing either of this division, or of
the nameless substance: he treats the soul as one and undivided,
and dlscusses chiefly its relation to the body, a subject to which
Lucretius devotes only three propositions out of nine. Further,
Lucretius himself tells us at l. 421 that he will ignore the dis·
tinction in future and treat animus and anima as synonyms;
and in the very paragraph in which he first distinguishes the
two, he insists that they together form a single substance Yet
it is clear from Lucretius himself and from other sources2, that
