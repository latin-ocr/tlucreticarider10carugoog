Epicurus did distinguish two parts of the soul, a rational part
localised in the breast, and an irrational part diffused throughout
the body ; these correspond to the animus and anima os Lucretius.

Epicurus found this distinction in the systems of Plato and

Aristotle, in both of which the soul consists of a higher or
rational principle and a lower or vital principle; and this dis·
tinction he maintained, though it seems to serve little purpose
in his system. lt is clear that he based the distinction, like
every other point os his philosophy, upon facts of experience.
The heart beats last in sear or joy; therefore the animus, which
is the seat of the passions, is in or near the heartl. Again,
a severed limb may be seen to quiver for a time upon the
ground; therefore the anima or life is diffused throughout the
body². Yet the emphatic statements of Lucretius³ show that
Epicurus insisted upon some sort of identity between the two
parts.

ln what then does the difference consist? We notice first
that all intellectual operations are confined to the animus: it is
the seat of the reason, of the passione, and of the will. ln
sensation, on the other hand, the anima plays the important
part. Suppose l burn my finger, Epicurus would explain the
process of sensatiou as follows. The external heat may touch
a large number of atoms of body without producing sensation,
which these cannot initiate43 but, if severe enough to be felt at
all, it touches also atoms of the anima which are present in
the finger as in every part and particle of the body. These
atoms are, as we have seen (in proposition iv), of four kinds.
The first to feel are atoms of the fourth nameless substance ;
their motions produce, or rather are, the sensation, which is
