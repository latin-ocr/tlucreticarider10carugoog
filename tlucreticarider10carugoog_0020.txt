then transmitted, in this order, to the atoms of heat‚ wind, and
air, and finally to the atoms of the body¹. Unless the burnis ⁴
exceptionally severe, the sensation is confined to the finger3 but
the animus in its central position, because of its close connexion
with the anima, is aware of the burn.

lt has been stated above that there are atoms ot' the fourth
nameless substance in the anima. This view has not been held
generally2: Munro, for instance (Notes 11 p. 194), supposes
sensation to begin with the animus, and apparently denies the

. presence of the fourth substance in the anima at all. Others
have identified the fourth substance with the animus, while
supposing the antina to be composed of the other three. But
neither of these views can be made good, unless we suppose
that Lucretius was grossly ignorant on a point of primary
importance³. For he expressly states: (1) that the animus
and anima form a single thing (tratura)⁴; (2) that no local
separation of the four elements of soul is possible⁶; (3) that
every sensation begins with the fourth nameless element⁰; (and
this must be taken in connexion with the dogma of Epicurus
stated above, that sensation takes place in the part affected, and
not in the anz'musl).

We must assume, then, that the animus and anima are
identical in substance, and differ only in function. This difler-
ence may be illustrated by comparing the whole soul to a swarm
of bees. The swarm consists of a nucleus where the bees are
closely packed together, and of outlying parts where the congre·
gation is not so dense; yet all parts consist of bees and nothing
but bees. So the animus is the nucleus of the seul-atoms,

⁹Both Giussani and Heinze state it independently. I doubt il
anyone will gainsay it in future.

⁸ It is out of the question to suppose that Lucr. purposely diverged
from the teaching of Epicurus.
