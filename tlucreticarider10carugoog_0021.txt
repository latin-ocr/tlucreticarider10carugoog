anima, diffused through the whole body, consists of atoms
exactly like the others but less closely compressed. The greater
condensation of atoms at the nucleus gives rise to a greater
complexity and variety of atomic motions; and from these are
derived passion, will, thought, and consciousness itselfl.

ln the second division of the book Munro counts twenty-
eight arguments against the immortality of the soul. As the
arguments are generally not isolated but arranged in groups
containing several similar arguments, it is sometimes difficult
to decide where one proof ends and another begins. But
1 believe that no argument of importance is omitted in the fol-
lowing summary.

(i) The atoms of which the soul is formed are very small
and therefore lack cohesion. Consequently, when the body is
destroyed by death, the soul is at once dissolved into its atoms
and dies too (ll. 425-444).

(ii) The rational soul (animus) keeps pace with the body at
every stage of development: it is therefore natural to suppose
that it dies with the body (ll. 445-448).

(iii) The soul, like the body, has diseases of its own, and ,
also is affected by diseases of the body. Even within the body
the soul is liable to violent assaultS, which would be still more ·,
formidable, when it had lost the shelter of the body. The fact
