that the rational soul (animus) can be cured of mental disease, ι

is itself a proof of mortality (ll. 459-52 5).

(iv) As the organs of sensation cannot exist apart from the
body, the rational 5ουί (animus), which is practically an urgan·
of sensation, cannot do so either (11. 548—5 57).

(v) As the functions of the 5ουί depend entirely upon its
union with the body, they mustcease when this union is dis-
solved (ll. 558-594).

(vi) As the departure of the soul is followed by the utter
collapse of the body, we must suppose that the 5ουί was rent
in pieces even before it left the body (11. 595-614).

(vii) lt is a law of nature that every organism must exist in
its own environment: therefore the rational soul (animus) can
exist nowhere except in the body and in a fixed partos it
(ll. 615—623).

(viii) tf the 5ουί is to exist and have sensation apart from
the body, it must have the organs of ’ sensation also; but eyes
and ears cannot exist apart frorn a body (11. 624-633).

(ix) lf a living body is suddenly cut in two, the 5ουί also is
divided; but that which is cut into parts, cannot be immortal
tll- 634-669l

(x) ln a case of natural death we often see the same thing,
that the bodily parts die one by one, as the soul within them
dies. Thus the 5ουί 15 divided and cannot be immortal (ll. 526-·
547¹l

(xi) The soul cannot have existed before the body, or it
would remember its past existence (11.670-678).

(xii) The close connexion between soul and body, which
we see in sensatim, would never be established if the body were
formed first and the soul then introduced. Thereforc th‘e soul
did not exist before the body (ll. 679—712).

(xiii) The living creatores that swarm in a decaying body,
prove that particles of the 5ουί remain behind after death. But
‘' if the soul that went forth, went forth diminished, it cannot be
immortal (ll 713—74 ).
