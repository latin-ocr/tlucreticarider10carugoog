Livia, the consort of Augustus lost her son Drusus, she sought
ind found comfort in the reasonings of Ateius, a philosopher who
lived in the palace in the closest intimacy with Augustus1. Nor
was it the bereaved only who had recourse to philosophers in
their trouble. When Julius Kanus was condemned to death
by Caligula, he was accompanied to the place of execution by
‘his philosopher,’ who questioned him as to the state of his
minat. Thus the philosopher played' a part which in modern
times has generally been filled by ministers of religion: it was
his business to comfort the bereaved, to console the sorrowful‚
and to encourage the dying.

Of these three tasks Lucretius here undertakes the last: all
men must die, and his purpose is to rob death of its sting and
to enable his fellow-men to face the inevitable end without fear
For this purpose scientific demonstration is not enough. He
has already heaped proof upon proof to show that the soul does
not survive death; but he has now to appeal to the heart as
well as to the intellect. For some men, who profess to accept
the scientific proof, do not really believe it³ 3 and others, who
do believe it, still repine at the ‘stern doom of every mortal lot’
These arethe two classes of men whom Lucretius has especially
in mind.

It is a remarkable fact that this missionary of an optimistic
creed has a considerable element of pessimism in himself.
Epicurus took a cheerful view of life ; but the tone of his disciple
is not cheerful: where it is not sad, it is at least solemn.
