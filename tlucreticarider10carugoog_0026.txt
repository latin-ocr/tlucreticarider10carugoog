xx INTRODUCTION ι

Lucretius is no cynic: 'with many other great qualities he has ρ
a manly tenderness of heart; buthe is never light-hearted. ρ
This may be due to temperament, to misadventures in life,
to anxiety for the future of his country. But it can hardly be y
doubted that he was thus led to exaggerate immensely the efflet
produced on men in general by the terrors οἱ death and the
unseen world. There is little evidence, either in the literature
or the sepulchral inscriptions of the Romans to show that such
forebodings had power to overshadow the whole of life and
darken every pleasure1. Yet this is what Lucretius expressly
says3 and it is from this fear that he seeks to set men free
lt should be noticed that Lucretius was prevented by his
philosophie creed from using two arguments which are generally
prominent in appeals ol this kind Seneca was a Stoic², and
Plutarch a Platonist ; so that both of them can speak con-
fidently of a future life of far greater happiness, awaiting the
souls of the wise and goodss. Again, they both insist upon the
miseries of this mortal life, in the spirit of the Greek saying,
that the shortest life is the best, and better still not to have been
born at all⁴. But Epicurus not only denied the future existence
of the soul, but also repudiated with horror the pessimistic view
of lilefi. As was said above, in Lucretius himself there is a vein
of pessimism: yet he nowhere says that lile is in itsels an evil,
and dismisses in two lines⁰ the thought which Juvenal expands

¹ See Sellar, Roman Poets osthe Republir, p. 378.

⁹ The Stoics held that the individual soul would survive until the
destruction of the world: as the world’s lise was calculated at 6‚570,000
years, Stoicism offered a fair imitation ol immortality.
