INTRODUCTION xxi

into a hundred, that by death we escape from calamities which
might befal us in the future.

There is another argument which might seem natural in the
mouth of an Epicurean-the argument of Horace,

Huc vieta et ungeunto et nimium breves

Flores amoenae serre iube rosae,
Dum res et aetas et sororum

Fila trium patiuntur aera1,

and of Omar‚

‘Ah, make the most ol what remains to spend,
Before we too into the Dust descend,

Dust unto Dust, and under Dust to lie,
Sans Wine, sans Song, sans Siuger, and-sans End!

But Lucretius does not believe that the only serious business ol
life is sensual pleasure, and will not say, ‘Let us eat and drink,
for to·morrow we die.³ To his austere and noble nature this
argument made no appeal, and he only mentions it to dismiss
it with contempt².

What then does Lucretius say? He can promise no heaven
hereafter3 but he tells men that if they have nothing to hope,
they have also nothing to sear, beyond the grave.

It cannot be doubted that in the life-time of Lucretius the
great majority of his countrymen believed in some form os
future existence³. Nor was this belief confined to the simple
and ignorant. Cicero, for example, though, like Seneca and
Juvenal in a later age, he ridicules the terrors of the Greek
mythology⁴, is finnly convinced of the soul's immortality. Bnt
