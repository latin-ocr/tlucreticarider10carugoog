Lucretius uses all his powers to destroy this belief, which
in his view has no foundation and is productiva only oi un·
happiness. His own gospel he does not regard as a message
of despair: on the contrary, he believes that it will bring peace i
into the world, and that it alone can cure that strange disease
of the mind, which prevents even health and wealth from making
life happy1. He is conscious, however, that he is fighting against
something deeply rooted in human nature: that even those who
do not believe in the punishments of hell, cannot tear out os
their hearts the instinct which makes us cling to life. ln order
to convince such doubters, he brings Nature herself upon the
scene and makes her remonstrate with her disobedient children¹.
Then he speaks of kings and captains, poets and philosophers,
none of whom escaped death, and asks what pretensions hat
amere ordinary man to be more highly favoured thau the
choicest specimens of our race⁸. Put shortly, his messageit
this: it is a fact, scientifically‘ proved, that existence dependo
upon the union of body and soul, and ceases when they art
separated: once believe this sincerely, and you will be indifferent
to the fate of your dead body; you will cease to regard death
as a state of pain or privation; you will not sorrow over-much
for the dead ; you will be content yourself to die and make room Ι,
sor a new generation; and you will be able to concentrate your
thoughts on this life, and live it well. Seeley has characteriscd
Natural Religion as follows: ‘As described here religion does
not brood over a future life, but is intensely occupied with i
the present; it does not surmise something behind nature, but '
contemplates nature itself; it does not worship a Power which ·
suspends natural laws, but the Power which is exhibited in these
laws; it does not damp enjoyment, but is itself the principle oi¹
all rich enjoyment ; it is not sels-conscious or seli-absorbed and
does not make us anxious about our own iate, but is the principle
which destroys self and gives us strength to rise above our
anxieties! Every word of this description Lucretius would,
have declared to be true of his own creed.
