There is another Roman writer whose treatment of this
question may be quoted here, as it hears a strong resemblance
to the view of Lucretius When Pliny published his Natural
History, Lucretius had been dead for nearly a century and
thalfl. 1t is probable that Pliny was not a professed Epicurean:
he was more interested in the acquisition of facts than in philo-
sophie theories: but in this matter he states the Epicurean
view. The subject of his seventh book is Anthropology: he
deals with man from his birth to his burial, and then disposes
thus of his claim to immortality:

creaturos eager to live 'for even... How insane is this desire that
death should make life begin anew! Once bom, we should
never rest, if the soul retains consciousness on high, and shades
exist in the world below. Death is nature’s best boon to man3
but this fond and foolish belief robs us utterly of its value, and
doubles the pain of facing death, because we must take into
