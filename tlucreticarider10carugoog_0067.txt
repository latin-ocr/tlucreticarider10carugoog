, This book, like the fifth and sixth, begins with a panegyric on
Epicurus: the first has one also (ll. 62—79) alter the invocation and
dedication prefixed to the whole work.

a. primus: cs. i66 primum Graius homo; v 9 princeps vitae ratio·
nun inuenit. Lucr. insists upon the originality ol Epicurus, because the
rival schools‚ notably the Stoics, denied it: cf. Cic. Dc Fin. i 17 in
plysiu's...totus cst alicnus: Democritea daut, perparuo mutam.

commoda vitae, ‘the good things ol lise’: cf. commoda sumit
(iv 1074)= this isa translation of the technical term συμφέροντα which
are distinguished srom the ἀγαθόν or summum bouum 'lvi 26).

These had always existed but were not perceived till Epicurus threw
light upon thern.

3. (imae genus decue: Epicurus was an Athenian citizen born at
Samos (where his father was a κληροῦχος) rac. 342. It should be
observed how Lucr. prefers not to name his master directly: cf. i 66
Graius homo: the name only occurs once in the poem (iii 1042) where a
periphrasis is hardly possible: to Lucr. the name is too sacred lor
ordinary mention.

uruus is an Epic equivalent lor Graecus, regularly used by Lucr.

4. licia, an arehaic lorm offic-sa, having a different suffix.

The language used is very emphatic and seems intended to assert
as strongly as possible his dependence upon Epicurus. In lact, there
is no reason to believe that Lucr. made any alterations in the system
which he found' rn Epicurus
