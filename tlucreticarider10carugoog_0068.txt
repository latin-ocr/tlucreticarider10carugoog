hirundo: the twittering of the swallow is contrasted with the
magnificent, is mythical, song of the swan. In view of the common use
ol χελιδών and χελιδονίζειν, Lucr. may intend to convey the notion that
compared with Epicurus he is a foreign stammerer.

y. tremulis, ‘staggering ἰ because of their render age.

8. et, ‘as‚' after consimile: ac is commonet, but even Cicero some·
times uses et thus: see Madvig on Cic. De Fin. ii ar.

9. rerum: the ‘things' are the tenets of the philosophy: Lucr.
supplies verba, not res.

paura, ‘of a sather’: cl· i 94 patrio noeane, ‘with the nameus
father.y

10. inclute, ‘thou famous man': the same epithet is applied (v 8)
to Memmius, to whom the whole poem is addressed.

charum Epicurus lest three hundred volumina of philosophy; but
his only extant writings are three letters, none of them long, which give
a summary account of points of his system; there are also many frag·
ments. The work most ahin to the poem of Lucr. was his treatise περὶ
φύσεως in 37 volumina. It is known that he left two epitomes, a larger
and a smaller, of his system; and it is generally believed that the μεγάλη
ἐπιτομὴ is the main authority which Lucr. followed, though his own

. language here surely suggests that he browsed at large upon all the

writings and extracted the matter of his poem from the whole field.

13. semper strengthens perperna: cs. v 3²5 semperque aetermfuere.

14. ratio, ‘system,’ ‘philosophy’: cf. l. 45.

vociferari, ‘to cry aloud’: it is a clear, loud message to man, uo

whisper in a corner.
15. naturam rerum, ‘the nature of things’: this is an equivalent

torpuere which Epicurus explained in his φυσιολιγὶα or account ol the
universe, the world, and man.

dimna, ‘superhuman'r cl. v 8 (of Epicurus) drus ille fur't.

16-25. According to Epicurus, the universe (ri πᾶν) contains
innumerable worlds (κόσμοι, ηιιιιιιίι); between these worlds are spaces
called μετακόσμιιι (intermundia), in which the gods live. Our world is
bounded by the empyrean or upper air (cethem in this the stars are set,
not worlds themselves, but forming quite small appendages to our world.

By his genius Epicurus was able to transcend the power of sight aud
discover what goes. on outside our world; and the same secret is revealed

to all faithful Epicureans.
16.- moenia mundi, ‘the walls ol the worth: 'nemine empyreum
which our world is bounded.
