NOTES. 39 .

17· drauum, ‘part asunder' ε a rare sense ol the word.

manant κενόν and is a noun. The eye of reason can see the
processes of nature, i.e. the constant making and unmaking of worlds,
going on (gera) throughout the universe, and can also see the invisible

. swarm of atoms flying to and fro in all directions. Though inane
strictly means ‘space where there are no atom's,’ it can also be used, and
isused here, for the whole of space including the atoms‚ and bodies
formed of atoms, within it.

18. divum numen, ‘the holy gods.' The following lines are a
translation of the Homeric description os Olympus, Od. vi 4² ,οὔτ’
ἀνέμοισι τινάσσεται, οὔτε ποτ’ ὄμβρῳ Ι δεύεται, οὔτε χιὼν ἐπιπίλναται·
ἀλλὰ μάλ’ αἴθρη Ι πέπαται ἀνέφελος λευκή δ’ ἐπιδέδρομεν αἴγλη.

22. ridet: Lachmann changed this to rident, sedes being supplied
as subjectr he says: ‘nitere dicuntur quae illustrantur, non quae

’ illustrant.' But the MS. reading is, Ithink, defended byi 9 nitet eltffusa
tumim caelum.

²4· This peace of the gods, which nothing impairs at any time, is
only possible on condition that they have nothing to do with the affairs
oi men. This is one os the most important doctrines oi Epicurus.

25. Achmeta omnia, ‘the realm os Acheron‚’ i.e. hell, the
place where the wicked suffer aster death. Popular superstition repre-
sented this as beneath the earth3 but Lucu, who with the mind’s eye can
penetrate through the earth, sees that there is no hell there.

templu is used sreely in old Latin in the sense os laea: Lucr. has
linguai templa (iv 624) ‘the mouth,’ mentis templa (v 103)3 Plautus
speaks of the sea as Neptunia templa (Mil. Glar. 413).

26. noc...obstat‚ ‘and yet the earth does not hinder.’

28. his rebus, ‘because ol these things!

uu refers back to l. 14: when Epicurus begins to explain the laws oi
Nature, thereupon Lucr. is filled with ecstasy and awe at the beatific
vision thus revealed.

29. percipit, ‘takes hold upon': again l. 80: Cicero would rather
say percepto voluptatem.

natura here stands sor the universe, perhaps also for the laws that
governit.
