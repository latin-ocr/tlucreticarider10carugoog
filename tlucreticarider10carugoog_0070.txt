avara'ce, ambition, and crime. Some men titas led 'to commit
suicide, others to betray their country,· there mbut one remcdy for
tt, and that is tlte philosophy of Epicurus.

Lucr. now states the subject of the book; but instead 01 beginning it Ι
at once, he goes into an ethical digression to prove the importance 01 it.

31. et quomam docnt: 101 this method 01 connecting the subject 01
the book with the preface, 01. 1 951; iv 263 vi 43.

cunctarum exordia rerum=primordm rerum, the invisible atoms
out 01 which all things are made. He explained the qualities 01 atoms
in book i, their shapes and motions in book ii.

33. sponte uua is opposed to ‘by divine power': for the atoms
have no power 01 spontaneous motion: they are driven downwards by
their own weight, and this downward motion is changed, first by a
swerve in their line 01 falling and then by the blows 01 other atoms.

aetemo...motu: Epicurus taught that all atoms, whether free or in
combination with others, move 101 ever at the same immense speed: the
atoms which form a block 01 marble are moving just as fast as the atoms
that form air or light. Modern physica] science also teaches that the
atoms 01 solid bodies are in constant motion.

34. quove: oe has the sense 01 que, as the composition 01 visible
things is not an alternative but an additional topic: 01. i 573 v 71.

’ Apparently Lucr. wishes to escape an ambiguity, as quoque might be
a case 01 quisque.

This sense 01 -oe is common in early Latin: in Plautus it has never,
except in sive, a disjunctive sense: 01. Asinar. 636 videtin viginti ntinat
quid pollent quidve possunt?

35. ree, ‘topica'

For the distinction between anianus, ‘the mind,’ and animo, ‘the
soul,’ cf. 11. 136—144, and see Introd. p. xii 1011.
