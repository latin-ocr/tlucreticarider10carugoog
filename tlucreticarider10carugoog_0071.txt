uoras. 41

ἄνευ φυσιολογίας ἀκεραίους τὰς ἡδονὰς ἀπολαμβάνειν. All science is to
Epicurus a means, not an end.

4¹· quod, ‘as to the fact that‚' may be translated by ‘when'

The apodosis begins at 1. 46.

4²· tutata Leti: also Virg. Georg. iv 481: the gen. is possessive:
Death lives in Tartarus and posscsses it.

43. ammae: ‘dativez ‘the soul has the nature of blood‚' i.e. the
blood is the soul. The persons here spoken of are not philosophers of
any school: they profess to be free-thinkers, but they have no scientific
grounds for their belief and adopt at caprice (voluntas), as Lucr. says
with soom, one opinion or another on this matter.

45. nostra ratio is the Epicurean philosophy.

46. n1n0=n τῶνδε, ‘from what follows’ in ll. 48-54.

Rudis, ‘ostentation’

47. ros, ‘the fact’ that death is not the worst of evils.

48-50. A striking commentary on these lines is ufforded ογ
Cicero’s correspondence during his exile. Atticus was an Epicuream '
and Lucr. may have seen some of the letters addressed to him.

50. demque, ‘inshort.'

vivunt, ‘they go on living‚' though they ought on their own

principles to put an end to their lives.
51. tamen, ie. in spite of their pretended belief.

5²· nigras pecudes: black victims were offered to the dead and to
the> infernal gods ; the devotions of these men are paid in all three cases
to personages whose existence they profess to disbelieve.

53. mittunt, ‘offer': for mittere, ‘to give away‚'·used without a
dat, see n to Juv. 3, 45.

55. mamare, ‘to test)

58· reo, ‘the reality‚’ ie. a cowardly dread of death.

59. dentque, ‘further': so osten in Lucr. This new point is not
easy to follow: it is not obvious that fear of death is the cause of avarice
and ambition. It has been noticed, eg. by Thucydides, that morality
is relaxed in times of epidemic disease; but Lucr. is not thinking of
exceptional circumstances. He is merely reproducing the view of
Epicurus, who derived these passions from an exeess of prudence: eg. a
man desires money in order to escape poverty, the extreme consequence
of poverty being starvation: cf. Epicurus (Usener l. l. p. 73) ἔνδοξοι καὶ -
