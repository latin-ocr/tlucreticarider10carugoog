61. socios scelerum cet-t Lucr. is here thinking of the Mamurras
and Vatiniuses oi the time, oi whom he may have heard much from
Memmius; in the similar passQe in book ii (ll. rr ioli.) he has Pompey
and Caesar more directly in view.

63. vulnera vitae, ‘sores oi life!

. 64. non minimam vatem: the qualification seems to show that
Lucr. was not quite convinced oi the argument himself. Asto the consta,
the acc. isused as an adverb: cs. vi 1²59 nec minimam partem ex agris
is maeror in urbem Ι confluxit. partim is only another form oi the acc„

65. ferme, ‘as a rule‚' ie. to most men. ¹

66. semota, neut. plur„ agrees with the masc. and fem. subjects
which precede it.

stabili: this word is the key oi the whole passage: ci. Epicurus
quoted above and Cic. De Fin. i 35 (an Epicurean is speaking) laudem
et caritatem, quaesunt vitae sine metu degendae praesideafirmisse‘ma.

67. cunctarier is govemed by videntur: obscurity and poverty
seem, as we might say, next door to death. So Virgil (Aen. vi 273)
makes turpis Egestas live at the threshold oi Orcus.

68. unde=a contemptu aegestate. dum, ‘because’

ae is subject oi effugisse: ea must be supplied as object oi rentosse.

69. effugisse...romoaaa: the tense is perhaps an old Latin idiom, by
which velle is followed, esp. in laws, by the peri. inc: cf. Hor. Sat. ii 3,
187 ne quis humasse velit Aiacem, Atride, vetas cur? More probably it
isan imitation oi the Greek aot. int, which later Latin poets use with
the exact sense oi the pres, ini.; but there is no other instance in Luca,
and only one in Plautus (Aul. 828 non potes probasse nugas).

7ο. rem manant, ‘they amass wealth.'

73. mennas odere: i.e. they sear poison: cl. Mart. xii 91, 4 lieres
lagonam.

74. ab, ‘in consequence οἱ)

78. intereunt, ‘wear themselves out,'not ‘perish’t by ambition they
seeksecuritybutgetsomethingquitedifferent. Hereagain Lucr. follows
Epicurus who condemns στέφανοι καὶ ἀνδριάντων ἀναθέσεις as pleasures
which are neither natural nor necessary (Usener l. l. p. 78 Schol.).

partlm=nonnulli and serves as subject to the verb.

ergo, when used in this sense as au archaic synonym of causa, always
follows the noun.

80. hamanoa=beminest again l. 8373 arareuse.

81. With a stop at the end oi this l., the mss. readxng'ia ia'xhy

ataactoiy: so Heinze.
