horus, · 43

83. hun0‚...huno=rbr aln,...rbn δέι hic, s'lle is commones in this
sense, but cs. Virg. Aen. x 9 qais metus aut hes Ι author arma sequi
ferrumque lacessere suasit? The personal acc. alter suadere is rare 3 but

cf. Vlrgil quoted above and Lucr. i 140 tua me virtus...sufflrre laborem ῑ
suadet.

pudorem, ‘honoun’

84. iu summa suggests a climax: ‘worst ol all.'

nestas includes duty to parents and duty to country, as the next 1.
shows.

87-93. Lucr. has a great love tor this simile: it occurs ii 55
and vi 35 ; part of it is found i 146, where nothing is said os the sears ot

children in the dark, so that the mention of the sun is really irrelevant.
In each book 'the simile marks the end ol the preface and is followed by

a resumption of the argument.

91. animi is governed by tenebras as well as by terrerem: radii
refers esp. to the former, tela to the latter.

93. speum denotes the outward aspect ot' nature, ratio its hidden
laws: the whole phrase isan equivalent ol φυσιολογία.

94-135. Fe'rst, the animus is an actual part of a man with a rlefireite
place in the body. The belief that the animus has no substentat
existence but is merely a harmoniam relation between the parts
af the body, is erroneaus: for (ι) the feeling of the animus, whether
pleasantor poinful‚ a's often the reverse ef the baetyr’s feeling,⁴ (a) wht'le
the body sleeps‚ the animus e's awake either to pleasnre or to pain.
Secondly‚ the anima also isa part of the body, not a relation between
the parts: sor life may sectatae nauch neutilatr'en of the body, and
thus depends, net on the body as a whole but an a few partiales
effheat and air, which therefore fernz the anima. Consequently the
notien af the seul being a ‘harmony' falls to the ground.

94. Lucr. deals first with the animus, the λογικόν or rational part of
the soul, and then (ll. 117—129) with the anima, or irrational part: see
Introd. p. xii loll. It is somewhat remarkable that he does not state
this two-sold division of the soul until the next paragraph.

quam agrees with mentem hy attraction: cf. l. roo: but this attrac-
tion does not always take place: eg. l. 139 carnalium qued nos aeriarum
nantemque vocantur. ΤΙιε mle, as stated hy hhadw'm, Quem& ”uhu
is, that attraction takes place when the relatus excuse anns a mh Q*
