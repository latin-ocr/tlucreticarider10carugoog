noras, 47

τετῶν φόβων καὶτῆς χαρᾶς. Η1 concluded this from observation of the
way in which the beart beats for fear or pleasure. See Introd. p. xiii.
sitummueret, ‘is permanently placed!

141. exultat denotes the ‘throbbing’ of the heart.

pavor, ‘panic fear'3 metue, ‘apprehension'

01er governs haec lma.

141. mulcent, ‘soothe a man’: cf. v 571.

¹43· wteru pars animae, ie. the animm: again l. 150. The
phrase is not exact, because the animus is not strictly part of the anima
at all; but Lucr. has to face a great difficulty of terminology here,
because he has no distinct equivalent for ψυχή which includes both the
rational and vitel principles. Hence he uses anima here αεεψυχή.

144. Action must in all cases be initiated by the animus where the
will resides.

1111111111 ωοιιιοιιαιιοενεΰσιν rol ῥοπήν, ‘the bidding and influeuce’
Other writers use momentum rather than momen with this meaning.

145. fd, i.e. cmnilium l. 139.

rapit, ‘has reason': the only distinct allusion in this book to the
highest faculty of the mind; elsewhere Lucr. speaks of the passions,
fear, joy, etc, which also are peculiar to it.

nudet: the opposite feeling also must be understood as implied by
this: cf. laeditur l. ¹49·

146. ret, ‘the impression'

una: adu, ‘together with the mind!

147—151 is not a part of the argument: it is rather a concession;
the real argument begins at verum: ‘though in some cases the emotions
of the mind may be confined to itself, the soul is affected whenever the
emotion is violent: consequently the soul and mind are substantially the
same thing:

151. amiate: the sense of the word is neutral here, though it
generally means a change for the worse.

153. mentua ‘feels in unison': a translation of συμπάσχειντ cf.
Cic. Dc Ν. D. iii 28 iste quasi consensus quam συμπάθειαν Graeci vocant.
All the symptoms which follow are physica13 but, as the body cannot
feel except through the seul, they are proofs that the soul is affected by
the mind

154 fta, ‘in consequence.’

toto corporo: this must be due to the anima which is spread through
the whole body: if the amincus alone were at work, the symptonis would
be confined to the breast.
