173. suavis, the Mss. reading, is retained by Heinze who supports
it by two interesting quotations: Seneca Epp. 77, 9 calda subinde
subfusci paulatim deficit, ut ahiat, non sinc quadam voluptate, quam
odfme solet lenis dissolutio, non inexperta nobis quos alc'quondo liquit

animus; Montaigne Essais ii6 (oi his sall srom his horse) il mc sembloit
que ma vie ne mc tenoit plus qu’ou boui des leores ; jefermoy les yeulx
pour ayder, ce me scmbloit, d la poulscr hors, etprenoy plaisirh m'alanguir
et ὰ me loisscr aller. Lucr. may have selt this sensation himself or
heard others describe it.

in terra, i.e. when the man has reached the ground.

aestua, ‘confusion'

175. enimi here includes anima: cf. l. 161.

176. corporeis, ‘material’

177-230. But what is the nrotcrial substance of which the soul is
made? lt is made of atoms which arc very small and smooth
and round. 7his is proved by the immense rapidity of thought,
which is motion of the atoms of the animus: for the speed cd atonis is
caractly proportmned to their smallruss, smoothness, aud roundncss.
Secondly‚ the anima also is formed of very small atoms: this is proved
by the fact that the body nndergoes no apparent change aud loses
no wcight when ihc whole anima is withdrawn at the nument of
death.

So Epicurus (Usener l. l. p. 19) calls the soul σῶμα λεπτομερές, and
also says (ibid. p. 21 n.) that it is formed ἐξ ἀτόμων λειοτάτων καὶ στρογ-
γυλωτάτων.

Giussani points out that Lucr. is not quite accurate here. In lact he
conluses atoms with molecules. A molecule of water is the smallest
particle ol water that has the qualities of water; any further division
would resolve it into atoms. According to Epicurus, all atoms move
with equal speed: the atoms of water move no saster than the atoms os
a block os stone: see n. to 1. 33: but water moves readily‚ because its
moleculcs (ὄγκοι, glomeramina) are small aud smooth and round.

177. corpore, ‘materialsubstance’

unde constiterit is explained in the next paragraph: constituitis
pres. in meaning: cs. συνέστηκε.

180. ’ perquam is used because perminutis is not ahrn'xnehhs sss
