181. htnc=ex vavae: ci. l. 46: ‘you may notice from what
follows, in order that you may be able to learn it thoroughly.'

182, 183. ‘No visible action takes place as quickly as the mind
imagines the action taking place and itself begins it’: ie. when a man
determines on any action, his imagination os it aud the act of volition
which the mind must originate‚ are instantancous‚ but the execution
may take long.

albi belongs to proponit. inchoat denotes the fact that any action
begins with a mental process: cf. iv 883 mque enim facere incipit
ullam l rem quisquam quam niens providit quid velit ante.

185. quorum: nent. plur. in spite os the sem. sing. antecedent.
The irregularity would be impossible after any other noun than res.

quorum natura=quae (naut. plur.): seen. tol. ¹30·

190. quippe, ‘because‚’ used with a participle, like ἅτε.

agunta, ‘atoms‘: etii 385: but, as is pointed out above, Lucr. ought
to have said glomeraminibus, which is his equivalent sor ὄγκοι or
‘molecules’: cf. ii 454.

191. The slow, heavy rhythm corresponds to the sense.

193. material, ‘oi atoms’ of honeyz neuterics is oue oi the
commonest synonyms in Lucr. of primordia.

194. extat is used in the sense ol constat.

196. namque: cf. l. 189: the repetition is remarkable and looks
like a ‘double recension‚' i.e. as if Lucr. had written two alternative
arguments, intending to select one for his final text. But there is this
difference, that he uses invisible atoms in his first illustration, and visible
bodies in his second. So the second namque may be subordinate to the
first.

To the examples of water and honey Lucr. now adds others:
a mere breath will upset a heap of poppy·seed, because the sends
are smooth and round, but will have no effect on a heap of pebbles
or ears of corn, because the pebbles are heavy and the ears os corn are
rough and stick together. The example os the poppy·seed occurs ii453
. in a similar context. Giussani, with great probability, refers the simile
to games still played by Italian children, in which they pile up poppy-
seed on the hand, and swallow it, the difficulty being to help blowing
it away. It is likely that the lapides and spicae refer to 'similar games.

papavera is made very emphatic by its distance from acervas.

aura suspensa, ‘a held-in breath‚' i.e. agentle breath: cf. v 1069
mpensis dentibus (os a dog biting her puppies in play); suspenso gradu,

‘ontiptoe.'
