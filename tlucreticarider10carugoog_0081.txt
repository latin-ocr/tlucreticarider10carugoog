Novas. 51

198. The only verse in Lucr. that ends in 4 spondeos. Virgil has
one such in the Georgics (iii 276), and two in the Aeneid <iii 74 3
vii ⁶34l·

199. noenu: again iv 712: itis ne unum and is an archaic form
of non: it is found only iu Lucc, but noenum occurs in Plautus and
other early writers.

The emphatic namu potest, following potest 1. 196, seems to prove
that both verbs have the same subject3 and, if so, the conjectures of
Munro and others for spicarumque are out of place.

maimo: Lucr. osten uses this form of the superlative; he
seems to reserve minimum for the technical notion 0f ‘least possible.’

What he says here is true of all very small bodies with the im-
portant exception of atoms.

noa. aspera: this refers to the spicae which are entangled and
held together by their rough beards: laptiles are not necessarily rough.

The ending of the l. is an echo to the sense.

206. o bono, ‘my good friend’: apersonal appeal to Memmius.

207. durabit means no more than erit.

· 208. olus: this would naturally refer to the animus which was the
subject of the last argument; but l. 216 shows that the anima is now
under consideration: the fact is, Lucr. feels that they are, in respect
of composition, identical: so they both appear in ll. ara and 228.

210. conglomerati: this is onlya supposition‚ the fact being that
the anima is diffosed throughout the whole body.

ara. indepto: the verb is formed by prefixing in'du to apiscor:

, cf. indugredi, impedire, induperator.

²¹3· nlllfbotum comos, ‘one can see no diminution’: the subj.
is potentiali see u. to l. 854.

²14· omnia mutat, ‘makes good everything,’ i.e. takes away
nothing.

²17· noxam-nervos: this implies that, just because the soul-

atoms are so mou, come of them are found in every part of the
body. ·

218. munuc, ‘since'= so always in Lucr.

219. mmmmm, ‘contoun'

aar. qoodmmot, ‘just't :velun

Booohl flou, ‘the bouquet of wine!

223. tuoto, ‘toste'3 not ‘juice'3 fora dried fruit is lighter than
afroshoue.

aab. mmm ouh, ‘surely because...’2 uiaticum 'ns very ouen
