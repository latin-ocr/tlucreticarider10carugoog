Nonus. 53

239, 242. ‘Since the mind does not allow that anyos these substanees
can produce the motions that cause sensation, lar less the thoughts
which it ponders in itseli’: i.e. warmth‚ wind, aud air cannot be sup·
posed to produce seusation, and much less to produce thought.

The expression is peculiar and seems to be ironical: the mind is
represented as dehating its own composition, much as the atoms (ii 978)

are imagined as discussing theirs. The textos l. 242 is uncertain:

quaedam of Mss. has probably intruded from the next la t'or mens

Munro reads res, ‘the facts of the case do not admit...)
mente=seeum

242. By saying that this substance was nameless Epic. meant that
we know no substance so fine that we can suppose it made oi atoms
as fine as those oi the quarta natura.

245. matt, ‘distributes’ Every sensation of pleasure or pain, and
every mental process, originales in this substance.

246. fistule, ‘atoms': cf. l. 190. In each stage ol the transmis-
sion ol feeling, the substance which receives the feeling is made oi larger
atoms than the substance which imparts it: the quarta natura is at one
end oi the process the assa and medullae at the other.

247. motus: acc. plur. 22222, ‘invisible‘z the epitbet might have
been applied with equal truth to each oi the other three components.

248. omnia, ‘all things‚’ i.e. the body as well as the soul.

249. meere—omnia, ‘every part of the flesh thrills with sensation’
In Lucr. viscera never means ‘entrails’ but always ‘flesh‚’ all that
comes between the skin and bone: and this meaning is common in old
Latin: cl. Plaut. Mil. Glor. 30 per caream, per vescera, Ι perque os
elephanti transmineret bracchium.

252. The marrow is the last to feel, because it is shut up in the
bones, and the sensation must reach them first.

252. ardor, ‘excitement,’ ‘emotiom’
252. huo, ie. in medullas, avital part, hence called αἰών. Lucr.
notes how seldom sensation reaches the marrow3 such a hurt must

prove mortal.
(This is Heinre’s explanation. Munro and others explain ltue

as=ad quartam naturam ; but the context shows clearly that every
sensation, even the slightest‚ affects the quarta natura first.)
aare malum, u‘sharp distress'
255. partes are not the four elements ol the soul,but‘txagxsems*
ot the soul, which is rent in pieces (scinditur l. 5gxh at heathx cimba·
cantumerulae ‘little holes,¹ ie. potes.
