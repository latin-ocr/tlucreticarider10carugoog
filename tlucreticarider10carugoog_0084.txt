256. m summo quau corpore, ‘near the suriace oi the body':
quasi is used in the sense ospoene.

258-287. The nextpoe'nt is tbe way in which tbesesour elemeeets are
combined sa os to produce sensatim ,· but owing to tae pouerty of the
Latin langunge, I eon only explain· tais in outline. The otonesos
tlee different etenunes are inaxtricably mixed up sa as to form a single
substance. As tbe saulis unseen and pereuntes tbe abab body,
so cle nameless clement, because formed os smoller atonn, is more
remote from olem tlcon tlee otleer tbree, andpermeates tlte whole soul;
it may therefore bc regarded as tbe soul os tle saul. So tbe other
three elemeuts are mixed up witlt auc anotber; any separation of
tbem would destroy sensation.

a 59. compta, ‘united ’: the word suggests, more than meleta does,
that the combination is regulated by fixed laws.

260. patrii sermonis egestu: at the beginning of the poem (i 139)
Lucr. makes the same complaint and excuses himself on that ground
ior inventing new terminology; it comes again (i 832) when he cannot
find a Latin equivalent lor ὁμοιομέρειαι. Why 'he repeats it here, ne do

each clement, being perpetually in motion, run in and out os the atoma
of all the other elements‚ so that no local separation (cf. spatia eliano)
oi any one elementis possible.

263. unum is predicate, not subject: ‘separately.'

265. vis, ‘ powers’: this plur. is used also ii 586.

compose the soul.

266. decere, ‘flesh': seen. tol. 249.

268. corporis augmen ‘bulk ot body!

272. The antecedent to andeis rnobilis illa vis, not ollis.

273, 274. latet, auberi, and infra en all express the same thing:
that, supposing a piece oi soul could be examined, the quarta natura,
owing to the excessivo smaliness oi 'ns aionas, wonkhhe the last to
