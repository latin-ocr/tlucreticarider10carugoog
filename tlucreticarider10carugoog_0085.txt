NOTES. 55

, sense of infru ci. iv ιη, where it is said ol atoms generally, sunt infra
nostros sensus.

276-281. These lines explain the phrase anema est animae: they
completely upset the theory, adopted by many, that the quarta natura
is contined to the animus. As, says Lucr., the soul permeates the
whole body but, being made of small atoms, is elusive, so the quarta ’
natura permeates the whole soul (and therefore the body), but is elusive
sor the same reason: thus it is to the soul what the soul is to the body.

281. dominatur corporeum, ‘isos paramount importance through-
out the whole body.’ The same phrase was used (l. 138) of the
animun ancl for this reason the erroneous inference has been drawn
that the quarta natura is confined to the animus.

The dominium oi the anima isan effective occupation ol the whole
body; the donu'm'um of the animus is rule carried on from a central
position.

282. consimili ratione: just in the same way the three other
substances are inextricably mixed up with one another.

283. commixta: neut. plur: see n. to l. 66: the emphasis falls
on this word, not on vegeant.

284. ‘And that oue should be (continually) more concealed or more
prominent than another’: i.e.· all are equally concealed and equally
prominent. Lucr. is trying to expressa very difficult notion. He seems
to mean ε as the quarta natura hides behind the other three, owing to
its composition,’so each of them is constantly hiding behind the others,
with the result that no one is more prominent than any other.

aliis may be either dat. aster subsit or abl. atter magis.

(Munro gives adifferent explanation of the 1., i.e. aliud aliis magis ¹
subsit in troc re, magis emineat in illa re. To this there seem two
objections: (ι) that a change of text in 1. 188 (etenim for etiam) is
required 3 (a) that ut must then have the limiting or restricting sense
which is confined to ita ut.)

285. unum, ‘a single substance.’

286. nl has here the sense of ne: so nive ii 734.

seorsum implies hostility: the word is scanned as a dissyllable.

287. diducta, ⁴ b'y their separation from one another!

288—322. The first three component parts of the seul may be seen in
(r) states ef meent (a) teeezperaments: unger is the siga οξ uae
