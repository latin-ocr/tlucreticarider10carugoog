nores. 57

311. proclivium ‘more readily’: Lucr. has in his mind the original
meaning os the word, ‘down-hill‚' as the verb decurrat shows.

3¹3· dommum aequo, ‘more meelrly than is right’: this man is
wanting in proper pride.

315. sequana, ‘clinging': it is proverbially difficult sor a man to
change his character: cf. curae sequaces (ii 48).

316. caecet, ‘invisible’ The differences of character all depend
upon the different shapes of atoms which form the soul.

317. quot: supply figurae, not nomina.

319· illud=r66e; ‘one thing)

firmare, ⁴ to assert ἐ confirmare is commonet in this sense.

320. πεπτω-τοί natural desects.

3²1· rano, ‘philosophy'z of course the Epicurean philosophy
alone is credited with this power. '

3²²· So Epicurus ends his letter to Menoeceus (Usener l. l. p. 66)
with the promise that by studying this philosophy he shall be free from
disquietude by night and by day, and shall live as a god among men.

323-349. Soul and body are in intimate aneon with each other: on
the one hond, the body keeps the seul together ; on the other hand,
the seul irreparts life to the body. The relatebn between the two is so
close that the soul cannot bewe'thdroum from the body without the
destruction of both. Sensation is produced by their anion. The
body cannot exist oport from the sorel. Their close union is proved
by the fact that they cannot exist separately.

This argument would be clearer if Lucr. had not omitted to prove
one half oi it, i.e. that the existence os the soul depends upon the body:
he only proves that the existence os the body depends upon the soul.
But there is a reason ior the omission: for the second part os the book
(ll. 417-829) consists entirely of arguments to show that the soul cannot
exist without the body.

323. haec natura=this thing, i.e. the soul, comprising the animus
and the animo.

tenetur, ‘is sheltered‚’ represents στεγάζεται which Epicurus uses in
the same connexion: see n. tol. 569.

3²4· ipse, ‘inturn'

salutis, ‘existence': so solvus osten=veioun

326. nemtoto, ‘destruction to both?

uon porge utentur, ‘they clearly cannot be'·¹ ciii. guz. 3th xxm
