natura etue, i.e. the frankincense itsell. The illustration would be
more exact, it Lucr. had said that both the scentand the stuff itself would

incense.

330. omnia, i.e. both soul and body.

335. The way in which sensation begins with the quarta natura ol
the soul, and is transmitted step by step to the body, was described
ll. 246-251: it is by the combined atomic motions ol soul and body
that sensation is ‘kindled and blown into flame throughout our flesh’
See Introd. p. xiii. ¹

Lucr. here speaks as it sensation were produced by the mere juxta·
position os body and soul, just as water is produced by the juxtaposition
ol oxygen and hydrogen. But this is not so: sensation is inherent in
the soul, and is communicated by the soul to the body (ct'. l. 357).

stated in l. 324, ie. that the body cannot exist apart from the seul,
in lact that the soul is causo solutr'r of the body. It begins with
praeterea which implies that the fact stated in l. 323 has already been
proved: but, as a matter ot lact, no argument has preceded ir, but only
a statement that body and soul are indispensable to each other, theu
an illustration of that statement, and then a repetition ol it
