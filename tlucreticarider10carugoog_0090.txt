357. enlm, ‘yese for...’= Lucr. admits the fact but denies the
inserence. Sensation is inherent (proprium) in the soul but not in the
body, not even during lise (in aevol: seen. to 1. 335 aud cs. Epic.
(Usener l. l. p. no) διὸ ἀπαλλαγείσης τῆς pixis οὐκ ἔχει τὴν deinum
(τὸ σῶμα)· orl γὰρ αὐτὸ ἐν ἑαυτῷ (proprium) ταύτην ἐκέκτητο τὴν
δύναμιν.

3 58. praeterea: ¹ other things ἐ the body loses not only sensation
but heat, motion, etc. .

expellitur aevo, ‘it is driven forth from life': this is said ol' the
body, though it would be more appropriately said os the man himself.

(The chief objection to Munro’s reading is that it requires a difficult
change of subject.)

359. Sight, as one of the senses, is now considered. Τὴε view,
here disputed, that the mind sees and that the eyes are merely windows
through which the mind looks, was common in antiquity and held both
by Peripatetics and Stoics: cs. Cic. Teuc. Disp. i 46 nos eninr ne nnnc
quidem oculis cernimus ea quae vademur ,· neque est enim ullus sennes in
corpore, sed...viae quasi quaedam suntad omlis, ad auris, ad naris a
sede animi perforatae....ut facile intellegi possit animum et videre et
audire, non eas partis, quae quasi fenestrae sint animi.

360. loribus: Cic. l. l. has fenestrae, and the Greek statements of
the argument generally have θυρίδες, which is more appropriate: and
probably fores here is a translation of θυρίδες.

361. difficilest, ‘is impossible’: cf. l. 328: itis of course possible
to hold the view but impossible to make it good. The view is contra-
dicted by the feeling we have that our eyes see: such uleeliug is
manis'estum and over-rides all argument.

362. ‘For our sensation draws and drives usto the eyes them-
selves’: ie. at the moment of seeing, our sensatiou conclusively points
(detrudit) to the eyes, not the mind, as the organs which see. The
object to be supplied with the verbs is nos or mentem nostram.

363. This is especially obvious when the eyes are dazzled and
blinded by a brilliant light: in such a case the eyes would see all the
better, il the mind did the seeiug.

364. lumina, ‘the eyes‘: luminibus, ‘by the light’: such a play on
words is very attractive to Lucr.: cl. i 336 officr'um.‚.officere; i 875
latitandi‚..latitare.

ι 365. But uo excess of light would preventawindow {rom giving
light to a room.
