exordia prima :primordiis-

Giussani acutely points out that most of the following examples seem
not to agree with the rule given. A spider’s web, for instance, must,
owing to its length, touch many atoms of soul: it is much larger than
the point ofa needle, to which atoms of the soul respond reedily enough.
In this case the important element is lightness (cf. 1. 387), not smallness.
It seems likely that, according to Epicurus, there are no atonis of soul
on the absolute sursace of the body, so that a very light object, even

Α if of some length, touches atoms of the body only, whereas a heavier
object, by carrying its impression deeper, does reach atoms of the soul.
And I think Lucr. may have intended to express this here: in fact,
the interualla are not of superficies, but of profrurdity.

381. incusem aretum has generally been explained by the use
of creta as a cosmetic. Giussani thinks that there is a reference to a
practical jolre ol street-boys (see n. to l. 196) who, unperceived, strike
people on the back with an object marked with chalk; but surely
vestibus would be needed then, not membris.

383. manet: the last two syllables coalesce: aranea is the common
form of the word. The ‘withered garment' of the spider is her web:
cl. Prop. iv 6, 33 putris aranea.

386. pappos, ‘thistledown'

387. meeum, ‘not lightly,’ ie. ‘with difficulty,’ is said in playful
contrast with levitate.

389. priva, ‘separate,’=singulas cf. 1371.

390. 01001010. is an euphemism: cl. l. 481: Lucr. declines to
mention pulices, cimices and even more disgusting little creatures; but
he hints at them.

391-393. ‘ So many things must be stirred up within us, before the
atoms of the soul, scattered throughout the frame in our bodies, perceive
that atoms (of the body) have been struck’: i.e. the shock, that a touch
imparts to atoms of the body, must be considerable, before it can reach
atoms of the soul and so produce sensation.

391. multa certainly refers to atoms of the'body; but it is doubtful
whether it is necessary to make it agree with prinmdia (so Munro) in
the next l.

392. primordia is acc„ hemina is nom. and subject to sentiscant.

394. quam 111 hle: for the hiatus, cf. l. 1082.
fn hle internatus, ‘being separate aslhare said* inl. 380.

tadltanne: a true frequentatires the atoms strllce and stilae egem
*alass each other.
