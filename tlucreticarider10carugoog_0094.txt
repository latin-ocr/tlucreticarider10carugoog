412. eorum, i.e. ol the pupil andos the ball. So, it all the anima
be removed, there will be an end os both anima and animus.

415. uflouul, ‘otherwise,’ though a rare word in poetry,is perfectly
appropriate here; to reject the verse (so Lachmann) on that ground
seems unreasonable, and to emend it unnecessary. The addition of cst

seems necessary, as Lucr. would hardly omit the verb in such a sentence.
416. wnotl: vaiacra would be more normal: cf. l. 136: the masc.

plur. is regular when the nouus are names of persons: eg. Orgetorix ct
filia capti sunt.

417-444. [shall now set forth praoss af tlte nrmality af the saul.
(thlher I use themora animus ar anima, you will understand that
Ι denote the saul by either, indifferently.) First then, Ι have shaum
that the atamr af tlte saul are snaaller aad have less cohesion than
tlte atam φ( water. But waler paura away and dr'sappeara when
tlte vesscl that contains it t's broken. Therefare the saul is at
once dissolved into atams, when withdrawn fram tlte body wlrr'clr

The first subject os the book is now ended, and the second begins
after a preface os eight lines. This is the kernel of the whole poem, for
the supreme object ol φυσιολογία is to demonstrate that there is no
future lile, and therefore no possibility os future suffering, sor the soul.

417. nuno age, ‘now mark me': the phrase generally marks the
beginning of a new and important theme: cf. i 265 and 921.

' nativos et mortam esso, ‘were born and must die’: the one fact
implies the other, so that Lucr· osten uses nativus as a synonynr of
mortalis. Yet both epithets are needed here: for the ancient champions
ol the immortality of the soul, chiefly the Platonists and Pythagoream,
held that the lile of the soul ‘extends backwards into the infinite past
as well as forwards into the endless suture’ (Archon-Hind's Phaedo
p. 19); while the modern popular belief is that the soul was born, or
created, but will never die. Lucr. argues first against the immortality i
Ι ol the soul (ll. 425-669)‚ then against its pre-existence (11. 670-783). ¹

418. levis: the epithet adds poetry to the passage and also indicates ⁶
some of the arguments which are to follow.

419. Here again the language does not suggest that Lucr. is simply

translating a popular hand-book oi Epicureamsm. See n. to l. ιο.
