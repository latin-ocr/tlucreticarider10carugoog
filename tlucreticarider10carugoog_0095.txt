4²²· vorbi ouum, ‘sor example,’ refers to animam: animum would
nave done as well, he means.

dicero pergam, ‘I shall in future speak ol....’

423· dicere: the subject me is understood.

424. He reasserts here the gist of ll. 136-160, the close connexion
and actual identity ol the artimus and anima: ‘they are a single thing
and one united substance’

quanam: seen. tol. 218.

ost: the verb is attracted into the sing. hythe predicate unuin.

animam must be supplied as subject ol constare.

oorponuua and pnnetpfls (427) are both ‘atoms’

4²8· lam, ‘it follows at once that,' is Lachmann’s emendation ol
nam. 1f nam is kept, there is a long parenthesis srorn it to the end ol
l. 433, aster which the argument is resumed with num r'gr'tur qnoniam.

At first sight nam appears to be right: for Lucr. before (ll. 179 soll.)
proved the tenuclae os the soul·atoms by their arabilium and nom
makes him do so here also. Yet in his atomio theory these two qualities
are so related that it seems possible he could prove each by means ol
the other. And the reasoning ol this passage seems to require iano.
Τὴο point on which Lucr. is here insisting‚ is not the tenuitas, but
the mobilitas, of the atoms, because this implies a want os cohesion
which causes them to be easily scattered. ,If nom be read, the cardinal
point of the mobilitas is put in parenthetically and only as a proos of
the tenuitas. Another objection to the parenthesis is that alternum
igitm quoniam, the original statement, ie. the tenuitas, should be
repeated3 but it is not.

4²9· magu goes with tenui.

430. mammons: Lucr. uses this word (and simulacra) to represent
the eltuto by which Epicurus accounted for sensation and thought. These
are exceedingly fine films which are constantly being discharged srom
the surface of all bodies, bearing the exact likeness of the body itselt.
When we are atrahe, a succession ol these images strilres the atoms os
anima in our eyes and causes sensation there, so that we see the thing3
but when we are asleep, they penetrate to the coriatus end t'ne sensuimus
tales place in it, so that we dream of seeing the obiect.
