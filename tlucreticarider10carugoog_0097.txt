311. prodinus, ‘more readily’: Lucr. has in his mind the original
meaning of the word, ‘down-hill,' as the verb decurrat shows.

313. clementius aequo, ‘more meekly than is right’: this man is
wanting in proper pride.

315. sequacis, ‘clinging't it is proverbially difficult sor a man to
change his character: cf. curae sequaces (ii 48).

316. caecas, ‘invisible' The differences oi character all depend
upon the different shapes of atoms which form the sonl.

3²2· So Epicurus ends his letter to Menoeceus (Usener l. l. p. 66)
with the promise that by studying this philosophy he shall be free lrom
disquietude by night and by day, and shall live as a god among men.

323-349. Soul and body are in intimate uneim with each other: on
tbe one hond, tbc body keeps tbo soul together ; on tbe etheriano,
tbe soul imports life to tbe body. Tbe relation between tbe troo is so
close tbot tbe soul cannot be withdroum from tbe body without tbe
destruction of botb. Sensotebn is produced by their union. Tbe
body cannot exist oport from tbe soul. Their close union is proved
by thefoct tbot tbey cannot exist separately.

This argument would be clearer il Lucr. had not omitted to prove
one half of it, i.e. that the existence os the soul depends upon the body:
he only proves that the existence of the body depends upon the soul.
But there is a reason for the omission: for the second part oi the book
(ll. 417-829) consists entirely oi arguments t0 show that the soul cannot
exist without the body.
