58 LucRnTwS, 111.

328. haud facile est=‘ it is impossible’

natura eius, ie. the frankincense itsell. The illustration would be
more exact, if Lucr. had said that both the scent and the stuff itsels would
be destroyed: the soul is to the body as the seent is to the bit of frank-
incense.

33ο. omnia, ie. both soul and body.

331. inplexis goes with interse, ‘interlaced’ The relation between
soul and body is like that between the different elements os the soul.

principue, ‘atoms': cs. l. 262: primordiis, like primordtbrum, is
excluded by the metre.

332. consorti—vita, ‘possessingliseas joint partners’t the metaphor
is commercial ε life is a sors or patrimony which they hold jointly.

3 33. quaeque is used, where we should expect altera, because os its
affinity sor ribi. '

335. The way in which sensation begins with the quarta natura ol
the soul, and is transmitted step by step to the body, was described
ll. 246-251: it is hy the combined atomic motions ol soul and body
that sensation is ‘kindled and blown into flame throughout our tlesh.’
See Introd. p. xiii. ’

Lucr. here speaks as if sensation were produced by the mere juxta·
position of body and soul, just as water is produced by the juxtaposition
os oxygen and hydrogen. But this is not so: sensation is inherent in
the soul, and is communicated by the soul to the body (cf. l. 357).

337. Now comes an argument from experience to prove the lact
stated in l. 324, ie. that the body cannot exist apart from the soul,
in lact that the soul is causa salutis of the body. It begins with
praeterea which implies that the fact stated in l. 323 has already been
proved: but, as a matter ot fact, no argument has preceded it, but only
a statement that body and soul are indispensable to each other, then
an illustration os that statement, and then a repetition of it.

339. enlm: there is asimilar elision of quidem 1. 9o4; but elision
os either an iambic or a cretio (m) before a short vowel is rare in ,
dactylic verse.

ut, ‘in the way that..)

340. qul datus est: ie. the heat is not inherent in the water but
comes from without, and has been added to the water to make it boii. .
