60 ⁵ Lucnurrus 111.

357. enlm, ‘yesr for...'= Lucr. admits the fact bnt denies the
inference. Sensation is inherent (proprium) in the soul but not in the
body, not even dun’ng life (in aevols seen. to 1. 335 and cf. Epic.
(Usener l. l. p. ro) διὸ ἀπαλλαγείσης τῆς ψυχῆς οὐκ ἔχει τὴν αἴσθησιν
(τὸ σῶμα)· οὐ γὰρ αὐτὸ ἐν ἐαυτῷ (proprium) ταύτην ἐκέκτητο τὴν
δύναμιν. ’

338. praemroa=⁴ other things ’r the body loses not only sensation
but heat, motion, etc.

expellitur aevo, ‘it is driven forth from life': this is said of the
body, though it would be more appropriately said of the man himself.

(The chief objection to Munro’s reading is that it requires a difficult
change of subject.)

359· Sight, as one of the sensas, isnow considered. The view,
here disputed, that the mind sees and that the eyes are merely windows
through which the mind looks, was common in antiquity and held both
by Peripatetics and Stoics: cf. Cic. Tusc. Disp. i 46 nos enim ne nunc
quidem ocules cernimus ea quae videmus ,· neque est enim ullus sennes in
corpore, sed...viae quasi quaedam suntad ocules, ad auris, ad naris a
sede animi perforatae....ut facile intellegi possit animum et videre et
audire, non eas partis, quae quasi fenestrae sint animi.

360. foribus: Cic. l. l. has fenestrae, and the Greek statements of
the argument generally have θυρίδες, which is more appropriate: and
probably fores here is a translation of θυρίδες.

36ι. dlfficlleet, ‘is impossible': cf. l. 328: it is of course possible
to hold the view but impossible to make it good. The view is contra·
dicted by the feeling we have that our eyes see: such a feeling is
nianifestum and over-rides all argument.

362. ‘For our sensation draws and drives usto the eyes them·
selves': i.e. at the moment of seeing, our sensation conclusively points
(detrudit) to the eyes, not the mind, as the organs which see. The
object to be supplied with the verbs is nos or mentem nostram.

363. This is especially obvious when the eyes are dazzled and
blinded bya brilliant light: in such a case the eyes would see all the
better, if the mind did the seeing.

364. luminu, ‘the eyes’: luminibus, ‘by the light': such a play on
words is very attractive to Lucu: cf. i 336 efficium...officere; i 875
laetandi...tatieare.

· 365. But no excess ol light would preventaw'mdow from giving
light to a room.
