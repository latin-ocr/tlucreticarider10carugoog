NOTES. 61

qula cemimus ipsi, ‘because it is we ourselves that do the seeing‚’
not the window or door.

366. laborem, ‘distress,' caused by excess of light.

367. The last argument is ironical: it the eyes are windows‚ then
put them out, in order to see better; sor a roorn will receive more light,

if you remove the windows, sashes and all.
368. lam, ‘in that case': cf. 1. 428.

370-395. lou must uot adopt the opimim of Democritus that iu our
body there is an atem of soulsor every atoni of body. This is not
so,· the atoons of soul aresewcr. This is shown hy thefact that very(
small aud very light substances moy toouh our body without causing
sensation: in such a case otoms of the body have been touched hut not
atonis oftho soul. Many atoms of the body must he totuhed before
oue atom ofthc soul is touched ond so produces sanction.

370. sslud=‘one view’: cf. 1. 319.

371. Democriti—sententia, ‘the opinion oi the revered suge, Ι
Democritus’: sancta belongs properly to viri: Lucr. would not apply
the epithet to an opinion which he proceeds to refute. The l. is
repeated (v 622) of a sententio which Lucr. approves.

372, 373. ‘That ecch single atom ol the body is placed next toa
single atum of the soni, and that the two come time about and so make

but privo, privas, pathos, and probis.

artemis is an adv. .

varlare is used intransitively.

374. animae elementa: ior the hiatus, cf. vi 755 loci ope.

375. quibus e: for the order os words, cs. ll. 839, 858.

377. dumtaxat ut... explains roro: ‘they are thinly scattered, in
so lar at least that yon can guarantee‘ etc.

378-380. ‘That the atoms of soul keep spaces between thern
proportionale to (mla) the siae oi the small (quantula) bodies which, '

if thrown upon us, are first (prima) able to excite sensation in the
body’: i.e. it a particle of dust touch the sicin, without being felt, then

the distance between two atoms of the soul must be greater than this
particle.
Ptlm goes with ciere, not with corpora, w'n'rdn ure usu susm
