exordia prtma=primord2a

Giussani acutely points out that most ol the following examples seem
not to agree with the rule given. A spider’s web, lor instance. must,
owing to its length, touch many atoms os soul: it is much larger than
the point osa needle, to which atoms os the soul respond readilyenough.
In this case the important clement is lightness (cl l. 387), not smallness.
lt seems likely that, according to Epicurus, there are no atoms ol soul
on the absolute surlace of the body, so that a very light object, even

, is of some length, touches atoms os the body only, whereas a heavier
object, by carrying its impression deeper, does reach atoms of the soul.
And 1 think Lucr. may have intended to express this heret in fact,
the intervalla are not of superficies, but of profundity.

38²· incussam cretam has generally been explained by the use
of creta as a cosmetic. Giussani thinks that there is a reference to a
practical joke ol street-boys (see n. to l. 196) who, unperceived, strike
people on the back with an object marked with chalk; but surely
vestibus would be needed then, not mernbrrlr.

383. aranei: the last two syllables coalesce: aranea is the common
form of the word. The ‘withered garment’ os the spider is her web:
cf. Prop. iv 6, 33 putris aranea.

386. pappos, ‘thistledown’

387. mvatlm, ‘not lightly,' i.e. ‘with difficulty,' is said in playsul
contrast with levitate.

389. priva, ‘separate,’=sr'ngulat cf. l. 372.

390. et cetera is an euphemism: cf. l. 481: Lucr. declines to
mention pulices, cimices and even more disgusting little creatures; but
he hints at them.

391-393. ‘So many things must be stirred up within us, belore the
atoms ol the soul, scattered throughout the frume in our bodieS, perceive
that atoms (os the body) have been struck’: i.e. the shock, that a touch
imparts to atoms os the body, must be considerable, before it can reach
atoms of the soul and so produce sensation.

391. multa certainly refers to atoms of the'body3 but it is doubtful
whether it is necessary to make it agree with primordia (so Munro) in
the next l.

39²· primordia is acc, semina is nom. and subject to sentiscant.

394. quam ln hle: sor the hiatus, cf. l. 1082.

111 1111 mrerratln, ‘being separate aslhaue said* inl. giso.
tuditantia.- a true frequentative: the atoms strike and sttuite agan
minat each other.
