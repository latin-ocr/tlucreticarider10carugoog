412. eorum, ie. ol the pupil and oi the ball. So, is all the anim.
be removed, there will be an end of both anima aud animus.

415. ahoqul, ‘otherwise’ though a rare word in poetry, is persedy
appropriate here; to reject the verse (so Lachmann) on that grmnd
seems unreasonable‚ and to emend it unnecessary. The addition of est
seems necessary, as Lucr. would hardly omit the verb in such asentence.

416. vincti: vincta would be more normal: cs. 1‚136: the masc.

plur. is regular when the nouns are names of persons: eg. Orgetorix et
filia capti sunt. ’

417—444. Ishall now set forth prooss of tlte mortality of the soul.
(thtlzer I use the word animus or anima, you will understand that
Ι denote the saul by either, indifferently.) First then, I have shmrm
that the atoms of the saul arc sarraller and have less cohcsz'on than
the atem eff water. But waler poure away and disappaars, when
the vessel that contains itis broken. Therefhre the soul r's at
once dissolved into arants, when withdrawn from the body wlrr'clr
contains it.

The first subject oi the book is now ended, aud the second begins
after a prelace os eight lines. This is the kernel of the whole poem, for
the supreme objectos φυσιολογία is to demonstrate that there is no
future lise, and therefore no possibility of future suffering, sor the soul.

417. nunc age, ‘now mark me’: the phrase generally marks the
beginning of a new aud important theme: cl. i 265 and 921.

’ nativos ot mortalis erse, ‘were born and must die': the one fact
implies the other, so that Lucr. osten uses nativus as a synonym ol
mortalis. Yet both epithets are needed here: for the ancient champions
os the immortality of the soul, chiefly the Platonists and Pythagoream,
held that the lile of the soul ‘extends backwards into the infinite past
as well as forwards into the endless future' (Archa-Hindb Phaedo
p. 19) ; while the modern popular belief is that the soul was born, or
created, but will never die. Lucr. argues first against the immortality Ι
Δ of the soul (ll. 425-669), then against its pre-existence (ll. 670-783). ·

418. levis: the epithet adds poetry to the passage and also indicates ’
some oi the arguments which are to follow.

419. Here again the language does not suggest that Lucr. is simply

translating a popular hand-book oi Epicureamsm. See n. to l. ro.
