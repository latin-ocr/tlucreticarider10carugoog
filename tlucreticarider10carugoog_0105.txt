At first sight nom appears to be right: 101 Lucr. before (ll. 179 soll.)
proved the tenuitas 01 the soul-atoms by their nzobilitos3 and nom
makes him do so here also. Yet in his atomio theory these two qualities
are so related that it seems possible he could prove each by means os
the other. And the reasoning 01 this passage seems to require zona
The point on which Lucr. is here insisting, is not the tenuitas, but
the mobilitas, 01 the atoms, because this implies a want 01 cohesion
which causes them to be easily scattered. ¹If nom be read, the cardinal
point 01 the mobilitas is put, in parenthetically and only as a proos 01
the tenuitas. Another objection tu the parenthesis is that alternum

repeated ; but it is not.
