like an adj.

456. 0011 fumus: 101 the norn, cl. ll. 427, 614.

So Cebes (Phaedo 70 Α) expresses the sear that the soul, in quitting
the body, ὥσπερ πνεῦμα ἢ καπνὸς διασκεδασθεῖσα οἴχηται danfrontem.

458. lousa is neut. plur, agreeing with animam et animum under·

459—525. Again, as tlte body is liable ta distare, sa the mind ean feel 1

griefandsear, and must therefore die too. A na' the mind is afficta!

also by tlte diseases os the body: the poison ry* alcelmi and the poison

or grief! But the position of this statement in the MSS. is inappro-
priate: ior Lucr. has there begun a sresh argument, which deals with
the effect of morbus only, and not dolor, upon the soul: there is no
dolor in lethargy.

There is certainly harshness in the double use of dolor sor bodily
suffering (l. 460) end sor mental suffering (l. 472); but Lucr. is not
careful to avoid this: cf. the double sense os mentiris 11 403, 404.

463· There is more than mere analogy: the mind is actually
affected by bodily sickness.
