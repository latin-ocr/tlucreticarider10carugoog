70 ’ LUCRETIUS‚ 111.

hilum, common in negative sentences (cf. l. 518), is very rare in an
affirmative sentence. Lucr. has only one other instance (iv 515).

5¹ 5. quicumque adoritur refers to the physician.

adorltur: cf. Ennius scu mortuu' siae moritur: adoritur is never
found.

516. naturam, ‘organism'

519, 520. ‘Whenever a thing changes aud quits its proper limits‚
at once this change of state is the death of that which was before':
i. e. a thing is what it is in virtue of certaiir characteristics (fines) which
make it what itis: if it loses these characteristics, it ccases to exist.
ln the present case, sickness of the soul implies change and therefore
death ; but exactly the same is true of heallng.

Lucr. states this dogma twice elsewhere (i 670, ii 753) and evidently
attaches much importance to it. No doubt he found it in Epicurus.
It states the main result of the Eleatic philosophy, and denies the
transformation theories os the Ionic philosophers, who believed that the
ἀρχή (or primary substance of matter) could be transformed: eg. that
water might be the ἀρχή and yet could, by transformation, produce fire.
The Eleatics asserted the immutability of substance.

521-525. This is the summing-up of all the five arguments con·

tained in the paragraph.
524. cucumere, ‘to confront.' The false theory can neither

advance nor retreat with safety‚ as the disproof has two sides, one

bearing on the sickness of the soal, the other on its cure.
euutl is=obountir cs. 1. 526.

526—547 are placed in the text after 669: see n. there.

548—557. The mind r's on orgon os remotiora, like the eye, aar, or
hand: and just os these, when separated from the body, lose their
pervers and decoy, so tlte noind cannot exuo oport from the body.

We have here, and shall have again, the argument which Lucr.
only hinted at in ll. 323-349, that the body is causa solutis to the
soul.

548. The special location of the mind within the body is not of
importance to the present argument: the argument founded upon this
fact comes l. 615 foll.

550. sensus, ‘organs of scnse': see n. to l. 626.

551- manue is the organ of touch·¹ Luculs not spealdngmerely of
parts of the body (or he might have instanced crus ur pean ‘out ol
