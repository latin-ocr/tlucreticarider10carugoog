574. ec, iecere.

concludere, ‘inclose': a translation of περιέχεινι see n. tol. 569.

592-606 are inserted here by Munro. As placed in the Mss, they
certainly interrupt the argument ; but editors are not agreed as to their
right place: Christ placed thern alter 579, Giussani after 612.

Munro’s arrangement seems to me the most suitable. There is this
objection to it, that the paragraph then ends with a double conclusion,
each os lour lines and each to the same effect (603-606 and 576—579).
This is not like Lucr. ·

The exx. show that liquisse has an object, aliquem, understood.

598. trepidatur, ‘all is confusion.¹ This allusion to the anxiety os
the bystanders gives vividness to the description and adds a human
interest to the bare laets. Cl. ll. 467-469.
