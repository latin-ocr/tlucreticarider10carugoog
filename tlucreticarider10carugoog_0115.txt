440. cura: some edd. keep vita 01 the iuss. and say that vt'ta:
morr'bus, or that the words mean ‘worthy to be your rule 01 tite!
1 cannot think either interpretation possible.

444. verbi causa, ‘for example‚’ refers to animam: animum would
have done as well, he means.

(110010 pergam, ‘ 1 shall 1011111110 speak 01....’

443. uicere: the subject me is understood.

444. Ηο reasserts here the gist 01 11. 136-160, the close connexion
and actual identity 01 the artimus and anima: ‘they are a single thing
and one united substance)

quatenus: seen. tol. 418.

oet: the verb is attracted into the sing. by the predicate unuin.

446. docui, ‘I have proved': 01. ii. 179 1011.

animam must be supplied as subject 01 constare.

448. iani, ‘it follows at once that‚’ is Lachmann’s emendation 01
nam. 11 nam is kept, there is a long parenthesis from it to the end 01
1. 433, 41101 which the argument is resumed with num agatur quoniam.

At first sight nam appears to be right: 101 Lucr. before (ll. 179 1011.)
proved the tenuitas 01 the soul·atoms by their ntobila'tas3 and nam
makes him do so bere also. Yet in his atomic theory these two qualities
are so related that it seems possible he could prove each by means 01
the other. And the reasoning 01 this passage seems to require 10411.
The point on which Lucr. is here insisting, is 001 the tenuitas, but
the mobilitas, 01 the atoms, because this implies a want 01 cohesion
which causes them to be easily scattered. ,11 nam be read, the cardinal
point 01 the mobilitas is put in parenthetieally and only as a proof 01
the tenuitas. Another objection 10 the parenthesis is that alternum
t'gitur quoniam, the original statement, i.e. the tenuitas, should be
repeated; but it is not.

449. magis goes with tenui.

430. imaginibus: Lucr. uses this word (and simulacra) to represent
the εἴδωλα by which Epicurus accounted 101 sensation and thought. These
are exceedingly fine films which are constantly being discharged 110111
the surface 01 all bodies, bearing the exact likeness 01 the body itseli.
When we are awake, a successiones these images strikes the atoms 01
anima in our eyes and causes sensation there, so that we see the thing3
but when we are asleep, they penetrate to the 01110101 auh 100 seusam
takes place in it, so that we dream 01 seeing the 0111001.

Smoke and mist are chosen because 01 their tenuitur, 1001111Ἓο ek
