riorus, 57

311. proclii-tus, ‘more readily’: Lucr. has in his mind the original
meaning oi the word, ‘down-hill‚’ as the verb decurrat shows.

313. clementius aequo, ‘more meekly than is right': this man is
wanting in proper pride.

315. sequacis, ‘clinging': it is proverbially difficult for a man to
change his character: cs. curae sequaces (ii 48).

316. caecas, ‘invisible’ The differences ol character all depend
upon the different shapes os atoms which sorm the soul.

317. quot: supply figurae, not nomino.

319. lllud=rbie3 ‘onething’

firmare, ‘to assert ἰ confirmare is commonet in this sense.

3²0· naturarum=os natural delects.

321. ratio, ‘philosophy’: of course the Epicurean philosophy
alone is credited with this power. '

322. So Epicurus ends his letter to Menoeceus (Usener l. l. p. 66) ⁴
with the promise that by studying this philosophy he shall be free lrom
disquietude by night and by day, and shall live as a god among men.

323—349. Soul and body ore in intimate unum with eaeb otber: on ζ,
tbe one band, tbe body keeps tlte soul togetber; on tlte otber band,
the soul imports lise to tbe body. Τ be relation betwem tbo troo is so
close tbot tlte soul cannot be witbdroum from tbe body ouetbout tlte
destruction of botb. Sensutzbn ir produced by their union. Tbe
body cannot exist spart from tbe soul. Their close union is proved
by tbesaet tbot they turmot exist seporutdy.

This argument would be clearer is Lucr. had not omitted to prove
one hals of it, ie. that the existence of the soul depends upon the body:
he only proves that the existence of the body depends upon the soul.
But there is a reason for the omission: for the second part of the book
(ll. 417-829) consists entirely os arguments to show that the soul cannot
exist without the body.

32 3. haec natura=this thing, i.e. the soal, comprising the animus
and the anima.

the same connexion: see n. tol. 569.
