357. enlm, ‘yest ior...'= Lucr. admits the lact but denies the
inierence. Sensation is inherent (proprium) in the soul but not in the
body, not even during lise (in muel: see n. tol. 335 and cf. Epic.
(Usener l. l. p. ao) διὸ ἀπαλλαγείσης τῆς pumirs οὐκ ἔχει τὴν αἴσθησιν
(τὸ orinal· οὐ γὰρ αὐτὸ ἐν ἑαυτῷ (proprium) ταύτην ἐκέκτητο τὴν
δύναμιν.

338. praeterea=⁴ other things’: the body loses not only sensation
but heat, motion, 111.

expellitur aevo, ‘it is driven forth from liie’: this is said ο1 the
body, though it would be more appropriately said os the man himself.

(The chies objection to Munro's reading is that it requires a difficolt
change ο1 subject.)

359. sight, as one os the sensns, isnow considered. The view,
here disputed, that the mind sees and that the eyes are merely windows
through which the mind looks, was common in antiquity and held both
by Peripatetics and Stoics: cf. Cic. Tau. Disp. i 46 nos enim ne nunc
quilleno oculis terruimus ea quae uidem& neque est enim ullus sennes in
corpore, sed...viae quasi quaedam suntad oaelos, ad auris, ad naris a
sede animi perfloratae....ut facile intellegi possit animum et viden et
audire, non eos partis, quau quasi fenestrae sint animi.

360. foribus: Cic. l. l. has fenestrae, and the Greek statements os
the argument generally have θυρίδες, which is more appropriate: and
probably fores here is a translation of θυρίδες.

361. difficilest, ‘is impossible’= ci. l. 328: itis of course possible
to hold the view but impossible to make it good. The view is contra-
dicted by the feeling we have that our eyes see: such a feeling is
manifestum and over·rides all argument.

361. ‘For our sensation draws and drives usto the eyes them-
selves': 11. at the moment os seeing, our sensation conclusively points
(detrudit) to the eyes, not the mind, as the organs which see. The
obJect to be supplied with the verbs is nos or mentem nostram.

363. This is especially obvious when the eyes are dazzled and
blinded bya brilliant light: in such a case the eyes would see all 1111
better, 11 the mind did the seeing.

364. lumina, ‘the eyes': luminibus, ‘by the light': such a play on
words is very attractive to Luca: cf. i 336 officium...officere; i 875 ἵ
latt'tauai'...latitare.

’ 365. But no excess of light would preventaw‘mdow irom giving ¹
l‘h'bt to a room.
