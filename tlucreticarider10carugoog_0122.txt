exordia prima :primordia

Giussani acutely points out that most of the following examples seem
not to agree with the rule given. A spider’s weh, for instance, must,
owing to its length, touch many atoms of soul: it is much larger than
the point of a needle, to which atoms of the soul respond readilyenough.
In this case the important clement is lightness (cf. l. 387), not smaliness.
It seems likely that, according to Epicurus, there are no atoms of soul
on the absolute surface of the body, so that a very light object, even
if of some length, touches atoms ol the body only, whereas a beavier
object, by carrying its impression deeper, does reach atoms of the soul.
And 1 think Lucr. may have intended to express this here: in fact,
the intervalla are not of superficies, but of profundity.

381. maumam motam has generally been explained hythe use
of crcta as a cosmetic. Giussani thinks that there is a reference to a
practical joke of street-boys (see n. to 1. 196) who, unperceived, strike
people on the back with an object marked with chalk; but surely
vestibus would he needed then, not membris.

383. monol: the last two syllables coalesce: aranea is the common
formos the word. 'Ibe ‘withered garment’ of the spider is her weh:
cf. Prop. iv 6, 33 putris aranea.

386. pappos, ‘thistledown'

387. granum, ‘not lightly,’ i.e. ‘with difficulty,’ is said in playful
contrast with levitate.

389. priva, ‘sepnrate,'=sc'ngulot cf. 1. 371.

390. et cetera is an euphemism: cf. l. 481: Lucr. declines to
mention pulices, cimices and even more disgusting little creatures3 hut
he hints at them.

391-393. · 80 many things must be stirred up within us, before the
atoms of the soul, scattered throughout the frame in our bodies, perceive
that atoms (os the body) have been struck‘: ie. the shock, that a touch
imparts to atoms of the body, must he considerable, before it cau resch
atoms of the soul and so produce sensation.

391. multa certainly refers to atoms of the'body3 but it is doubtful
whether itis necessary to make it agree with pca'nrordciz (so Munrojin
the next l.

392. primordia is acc, domina is nom. and subject to miscunt.

394 guam ln his: for the hiatus, cf. l. 1082.
