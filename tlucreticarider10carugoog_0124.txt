be removed, there will be an end of both anima and animus.

415. ahoqui, ‘otherwise' though a rare word iu poetry, is persedy
appropriate here; to reject the verse (so Lachmann) on that grmnd

seems unreasonable, and to emend it unnecessary. The additiones est
seems necessary, as Lucr. would hardly omit the verb in such a sentence.
416. vincti: veneto would be more normal: cf. l. 136: the masc·

plur. is regular when the nouus are names ol persons: eg. Orgetorix et
filia capti sunt.

417—444. Isholl now set forth proeffs of tho nrortale'ty of the soul.
(Whether I use the word animus or anima, you will understand thot
J denote the soul by nither, indifferentlya) First then, I have shown
thot the otoms of the soul are storaller arrd have less cohesion than
the otoms eff water. Bur water ponrs away and disappears, when
the vessel that contains n is broken. Therefore the soul is ot
once dissolved into atonis, when withdrawn from the body which
contains it.

The first subjectos the book is now ended, and the second begins
after a presace of eight lines. This is the kernel of the whole poem, sor
the supreme object oi φυσιολογία is to demonstrate that there is no
future lise, and therefore no possibility of future suffering, sor the soul.

beginning oi a new and important theme: ci. i 265 and 9²1·

' nativos et mortalitatem, ‘were born and must die': the one fact
implies the other, so that Lucr. oiten uses nativus as a synonym ot'
mortalis. Yet both epithets are needed here: sor the ancient champions
os the immortality of the soul, chiefly the Platonists and Pythagoream,
held that the life oi the soul ‘extends backwards into the infinite past
as well as sorwards into the endless future’ (Archer·Hind’s Phaedo

p. 19) ; while the modern popular belief is that the soul was born, or Ι
created, but will never die. Lucr. argues first against the immortality ⁵

oi the sonl (11. 425—669), then against its pre-existence (ll. byn-783). ¹
418. levis: the epithet adds poetry to the passage and also indicates ¹ p
some ot the arguments which are to follow.
419. Here again the language does not suggest that Lucr. is simply
translating a popular hand-book oi Epicureamsm. See n, to l. ιο. ’
Munro believes that all the arguments are talien trous one othe Χ

evolantem of Epicurus περὶ φύσεως.
