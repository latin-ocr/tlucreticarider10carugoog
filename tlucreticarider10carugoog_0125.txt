44ο. oum: some edd. keep vita of the ross, aud say that vita:
osoribus, or that the words mean ‘worthy to be your rule ol life.‘
l cannot think either interpretation possible·

444. verh1oausa, ‘ior example‚’ refers to animam: animum would
have done as well, he means.

dicare pergam, ‘I shall in future spealr of....'

443. dicero: the subject me is understood.

444. He reasserts here the gist of ll. 136-160, the close connexion
und actual identity of the artimus and anima: ‘they are a single thing
and one united substance!

quamam: seen. tol. 218.

oet: the verb is attracted into the sing. by the predicate unalia.

446. dooul, ‘I have proved ’: cs. ll. 179 soll.

animam must be supplied as subject os constare.

eorporlbus and nfinclplls (447) are both ‘atoma’

448. lam, ‘it follows at once that,' is Lachmann's emendation ol
nam. Is nam is kept, there is a long parenthesis srom it to the end ol
l. 433, alter which the argument is resumed with naam igitur quoniam.

At first sight nam appears to be right: sor Lucr. before (ll. 179 loll.)
proved the tenuatus of the soni-atoms by their nvabrlita53 andnam
makes him do so here also. Yet in his atomic theory these two qualities
are so related that it seems possible he could prove each by means os
the other. And the reasoning of this passage seems to require iam. ³
The point on which Lucr. is here insisting‚ is not the tenuitas, but
the mobilitas, ol the atoma because this implies a want of cohesion
which causes them to be easily scattered. ‚Is nam be read, the cardinal
point of the mobilitas is put in parenthetically and only as a proos of
the tenuitas. Another objection to the parenthesis is that alternum
igilm quoniam, the original statement, i.e. the tenuitas, should be
repeated3 but it is not.

449. magle goes with tenui.

43⁰· tmngtnluum Lucr. uses this word (and simulacra) to represent
the εἴδωλα by which Epicurus accounted lor sensation and thought. These
are exceedingly fine films which are constantly being discharged srom
the sursace oi all bodies, bearing the exact likeness of the body itsell.
When we are awake, a succession of these images strikes the atoms of
anima in our eyes and causes sensation there, so that we see the thing3
but when we are asleep, they penetrate to the anilitas auh ine aemam
