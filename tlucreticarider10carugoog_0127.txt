absurd. (To Lucr. ‘invulnerable' and ‘immortal’ are synonymous
terms.) Ι

There is no connexion between this argument, so understood, and
that, which begins at l. 819. Lucr. here objects that the union ol a
vulnerable and an invulnerable is absurd; it is no answer to say, what
is there said, that the invulnerable may remain invulnerable.

series ol arguments, it is eminently natural that Lucr. should draw a
