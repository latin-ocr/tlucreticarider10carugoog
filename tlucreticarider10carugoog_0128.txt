marana corpora is one of his many names for ‘atoma'

810. ante, i.e. in his first book.

811. inane, τὸ κενόν, ‘void,’ is the second factor of the universe: it
is not merely the negation of body: it exists as truly as body: but it is
intangible substance (ἀναφὴς φύσις, intactilis natura), so that blows of
atoms cannot touch it.

8¹3· neque ab totu fungitur mum, ‘and is not affected in the
least in consequence of a blow.¹

For ab ictu, cf. ab rebus l. 8202 for mugitur- (the passive offacit),
see n. tol. 168.

814. nulla loct copta, ‘no abundance of room’: locus (τόπος) is
‘void ’ considered as the medium in which bodies are placed.

816. summarumeumma is the universe (τὸ πᾶν);1ιαεινινιιηιεπηιιηα
is ‘this world,¹ lit. the aggregate of matter which wc see.

817. qrt=aliqui e ullus would be more usual.

dlfflrgtaut sc. res.

818. After this l. something is lost: see the analysis above: another
indication of this is the absence of the subject (anima) to kalendant.

819. It now occurs to Lucr. that there isa fourth thing in the
Epicurean system which is immonni. i.e. the gods. Can the sonl be
immortal for the same reason as the gods? They are immortal because
of their composition: their bodies are formed by a perpetual succession
of atoms in the intermundia where they live: these atoms by their
confluence form the divine being for a moment and then stream away,
and their place is taken by others. The divine substance is thus
constautly changing and as constantly being renewed. lusan, an eternal
water-sall will give an illustration of the composition and continued
existence of these gods.

(Ginssani was the first to give this interpretation of the passage. H is
view is strongly supported by a text of Stobaeus (Usener l. l. p. 139 n.)
which says that Epicurus recognisedfour immortal substances, τὰ ἄτομα,
τὸ κενὸν, τὸ ἄπειρον, τὰς ὁμοιότητας (which refers to the gods, as made of
asuccession of similar combinatione of atoms). Lucr. takes these four
in'exactly the same order.)

meo megia, ‘for the reason that follows rather’ than for those
which precede ¹andaccount for the eternity of atoms, void, and the uni-
verse.

The subject anima has to be supplied.
