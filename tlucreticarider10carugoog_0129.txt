Epicurus taught that there was a perpetual war between the preserving
and destroying forces ol nature: their power is exactly equal‚ so that
sor everything that is dissolved into atoms, a new thing is made, and
the sum of matter in the universe remains constant.

muntia ab is unusual ior the simple abt: but Lucr. uses this ab os
things, 'as well as persons, with some ireedomr cs. l.‘ 813.

821. eut, ‘either’r there are two ways in which the preserving
forces may work. veniunt: see n. to 1. 752.

allona sulutts=‘causes of destruction': according to Epicurus all
things are destroyed either by violent assault from without or by
disintegration from within (ll. 807, 808); but in the latter case also
the destructive force tirst comes from without aud then works from
within.

823. sentire queamus, ‘before we,' i. e. our souls, ‘can feel?

The l· printed below the text was suggested by Lachmann to supply
the missing apodosis of the sentence.

8²4· praeterquam malie one word.

cum is the preposition.

The soul suffers (1) bodily pain in the present, (a) sear ior the suture,
(3) sorrow for the past. But the two last are most prominent here:

what seems to him the most striking difference is the presence in the

827. praeteritis mule admissis is abl. absol.

828. furorem admonentium, ‘madness peculiar to the mind,' is
opposed to the delirium caused by bodily sickness: cf. l. 464. The
same epithet must be supplied with oblivia rerum.

ἢ 830—869. Since the soul is morial, death is nothing to us. Just os
evenis which happened before we were born were nothing to us,
so whatever may hoppen after our death cannot effect us ot all. (If
it were possible for our toul to feel oster leaving the body, that
