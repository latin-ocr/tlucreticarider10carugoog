Lucr. now begins to draw the practical inferences from the pre·
ceding arguments. ·

83ο. Other philosophers had said: ‘Death is not an evil’; Epicurus
said more: he said (Usener tl. p. 71) ὁ θάνατος οὐδὲν πρὸς ἡμᾶς· τὸ γὰρ
διαλυθὲν ἀναισθητεῖ, τὸ δ’ ἀναισθητοῦν οὐδὲν πρὸς dude: and (tl. p. 61)
τὸ φρικωδέστατον τῶν κακῶν, ὁ θάνατος, οὐθὲν τοὺς ἡμᾶς, ἐπειδή τερ ὅταν
μὲν ἡμεῖς ὦμεν, ὁ θάνατος οὐ πάρεστιν, ὅτανδ’ ὁ θάνατος παρῇ, τόθ’ ἡμεῖς
οὐκ ἔσμεν. Lucr. reproduces both these arguments in this paragraph.

831. habetur, ‘is considered’e cp. l. 3¹9² Lucr. assumes that his
arguments have carried conviction.

832· He takes the most stirring event in all the past history os
Rome, the Second Punic War.

aegil is partitive, alter ru'l.

835. horrida contremuere, ‘shuddered and qnaked.¹

836. luero: the subject is omnes humani (cl. l. 8ο) which appears
first in the relative clause: see n. to l. 133.

utrorum: the Carthaginians have been mentioned3 the Romans it
is unnecessary to mention. Cf. Livy xxix 17, 6 (hom au anbassador’s
speech in the Senate) in do'scrimino est num humanum omne genus,
ulrum vos an Carthaginienses prina‘pes terrorum videat.

839. uniter epu, ‘formed into a single being': ci. ll. 805, 845:
our identity and personality depend upon the organic unica oi body and
soul.

¹ , 842. The phrase is often figuratively used: seen. to Juv. 6, ο83.
But here Lucr. means literally that a much more frightlul catastrophe
than the Punic wars, the actual destruction of the world, would be
nothing to a dead man.

843-861 contains a digression, in which Lucr. makes two sup
positions, the first of which he has repeatedly proved impossible
(eg. ll. 624-633); hut the second he a‘dmits to be probabla or even
more than probable.

(Though the device of a bracket has been used in the text, itis

probable that these lines are not really a digression buta kind ol note,
