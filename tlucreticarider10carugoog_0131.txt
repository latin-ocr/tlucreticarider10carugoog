noras. 91

with what precedes is natural and satisfactory, the entire absence of any
indication at l. 862 that the former theme is now resumed, would be
impossible in a finished work: If the lines are omitted, the argument
of the whole paragraph is simple and straightforward.

Munro, following Lachmann, supposed that ll. 862-869 were con·
nected with what immediately precedes· If this were so, the words
would have to bear this meaning: ‘is any man noto living isto suffer
in some future re·incarnation os his present seli, his personal identity
must persist in that future life. Since death makes this impossible,
and destroys tlte identito of him, on whom suffering can be inflicted, we
may be sure that there is nothing for us to sear after death, and that, as
he wlco exists now is not rb'entical with him zolro will exist then, he
cannot suffer then.' But it will be seen that the words in italics, which
are essential to the argument, are not really contained in the Latin.

A further objection to this interpretation is found inl. 868, where
the MS. reading an nullo is meaningless, if Lucr. is here speaking os
the supposed reincarnation os a man now living. Lachmann accordingly
read ante ullo, Munro anne ullo.

But is Lucr. has now gone back to the original subject of the
paragraph, i. e. that what happens after our death does not concern us,
then ll. 868, 869 are quite to the point, without any change oi reading.
He says in effect: ‘our little life is rounded by a sleep: it is a mere
speck in the midst of two infinities, during both oi which' we are not
living; so that, when the briei episode of his lile is over, the dead man
is in the same position as ii he had never been bom.’

This explanation oi the passage is adapted from Giussani’s commcn-
tary. Brieger was the first to dismiss Lachmann's interpretation.)

843. The natural order os the words is: etsi ianr artiori natura
sentit, postquam do corpore nostro distracta est. Lucr. might have
written sentit nostro3 but he seems to have a liking sor such inversions
ol the natural order. Ovid has many such: eg. π’ quis in hoc artem
populo non novit amandi.

iam, ‘lor the sake os argument’: see n. to 1. 540.

845. emptu coniugioque, ‘by the binding tie ol marriage·
between....'

Lucr. means: ‘my soul is not me, my body is not me, my body
and soul together are me; but (ll. 847-853) if they come together
again, they are a different me.’ .

847. maronem, ‘atoms’ both ol body and oi soni. ’

85⁰· Μ quoqne facium, ‘even that result?
