851. repetentia 1100111, ‘the chain 01 our consciousness,' ie. the
power 01 retracing our past and recognising our identity at each stage.
852, 853. ‘So, in fact, we are not concerned about the personality
(nobis), which we have been before, nor do we now feel any distress
about that personality.’ Lucr. is now showing that what he had
suggested as a hypothesis (l. 847), is a reality.
853. illie, sc. nobis, ‘our former selves'
854. nam refers to a suppressed thought, i.e. ‘and there must have
· been such previous combinations 01 our atoms : sar ete.¹
oum respicias, ‘when one considers’: when the second person

motions have ceased to produce sensation. Cf. 1. 924 longe ab sensiferis
pn'taerardia molibus errant: the meaning is the same here, though the
expression is peculiar: the atorns uulueh produce sensation are still in
motion during the stoppage 01 lile, but, as they are nolonger shxntuu'xn

the body, they are not semiferi.
