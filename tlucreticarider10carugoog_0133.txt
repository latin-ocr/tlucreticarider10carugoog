possibility oi future combinations oi the same atoms, so asto reproduce .
the same individual.

probet is a contracted form oi prohibet, like debere and praebere irom
delibere and praehibere.

865. illum, i.e. the dead man.

870—893. Yet so persistent is this false view of death, that even
some men who profess to believe that death ends sensatim, are
yet distressed at the thought that their dead body may rot or be ¹

Ι burned or devourea' by beasts. This shows that they do not really
believe what they profess to believe, but nnconscionsly imagine them-
selves to survive their oron death, so os to feel what happens to their
dead body ; which is, in fact, impossible. Whatever neay be the fate
oforw body aster death, it is a tnntter of indifference to us.
