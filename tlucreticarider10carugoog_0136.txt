96 nuenarius 111.

901. super, ‘als0’: cf.1.672.

tint insidet, ‘is in thy beart!

una: the meaning is apparently that together with the joys oi lite,
all desire for them is gone. But this is strangely expressed; and ⁸
Giussani may be right in reading ullum.

90²· dictisque sequantur, ‘and make their words (of mouming)
correspond to it.’

904-908 are either an inconsistent addition to the former tament,
or the words oi another moumer who takes quite a different view
t‘rom the first, i.e. that the dead man is happy and enviable but has lett
eternal grief to those who survive.

904. quidem ut: for the elision‚ cf. l. 339.

’ aevi quod superest, ‘for all remaining time.‘

906. The body has been reduced to ashes on the pyre amid the
tears of the mourners, before this tament is spoken.

cinefactum seems to have the sense of cim'ficatum‚ and to be formed
by salse analogy from such words as tumefactum and ntadcfirctum.

prope=‘standing by’r lit. ‘from close at hand.¹

907· insatiabiliter is imitated by Horace Epp. i 14, 7 rapto de
fratre dolentis! insolabiliter. The rhythm of this verse, composed oi
three words, is unusual.

909. ab boc: hicisthe second mourner who has just spoken. The
mention os the person serves sor inverted commas here, as addunt (l. 900)
does after the first speech.

910. ros rodit att, ‘the result is': redit is idiomatic and has no sense
os ‘retuming': cf. v 1141 res adfaeccm...redibat.

somnum refers back to sopitus, l. 904.

911. cur=utobcamrcm. ·

919-930 were transposed to this place by Susemihl. It is obvious
that they come in well here, whereas after 1. 918 the connexion is hard
to see. It might be possible to make a connexion thus: the dead man
feels desire sor nothing: for in sleep we desire nothing: therefore stit,
less in death. ButI believe the transposition to be necessary and right ,

· 919, 9²0· Lucr. argues: ‘Yon admit that death isasleep: veliin
sleep we leel no sense of distress or privation' -

919. ac vitamque: when sound asleep, we are dead to self mette t
but do not miss them.

920. mona: the mind may wake when the body sleeps (ct. ll rra
-116),· but in the present case the sleep is very sound, and the mind

stares r't. sopita refers to real sleep.
