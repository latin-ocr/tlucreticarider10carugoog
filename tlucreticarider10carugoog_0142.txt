100 nuenarius 111. ·

956. meroes refers here to physical decay only: cf. 1. 946.

957. A regular reproach of ancient moralists: cf. Pind. [yth. 3, ro
ἤρατο τῶν ἀπεόντων, oia καὶ πολλοὶ eddon: Thuc. vi 13 δυσέρωτας εἶναι
τῶν ἀπόντων.

958. unt elapsast, ‘has slipped from your grasp’

960. manua rerum, ‘filled with good things ἐ cs. l. 1004.

961. tamen, i.e. although not satur ac plenus.

962. nedum (or age) sharpens an imperative: quaeso or amodo
soltens it. χ

nutis: so Bemays for magnis oi uss: concede seems to require
a dat: a new generation pushes out the old 3 and the old must make a
virtue of necessity.

Another likely emendation is magnus, ‘like a man‚’ for which
Munro quotes Sen. Epp. 110, 18 illam uocem magnus utque animosus
exclama.

963. agat. ‘she would bring her charge': atechnical phrase oi the
law-court, like intendere litem l. 950.

966. uanum ‘the pit,' is here the same as Tartarus: ci. Homll.
viii 13 ῥίψω ἐς Τάρταρον ἠερόεντα, Ι τῆλε μάλ’, ἥχι βάθιστον ὑπὸ χθονός
ἐστι βέρεθρον.

No dead man goes down to a world below: heis dissolved into his
atoms here on earth ; for Nature needs these atoms to make something
new out os them. ι

967. materies, ‘his atoms,'·is subject to est, opus being the pre-
dicate: the constr. is common in Lucr.: cf. i 1051, ii 815, iu 1268,
1277: but he sometimes (eg. v 1053 quid sit opus facto) makes opus
govem the abl.

968. vita perfuncta. ‘when they have ended their term of liie’:
lor an acc. alter fungi, cl. l. 956.

969. aute is the adv.

haec is obscure: it cannot refer to postero saeclo, as the tense oi
cecidere is unsuitable r it seems to stand sor saecla generally, as ispertera
had been iorgotten.

971. ‘Life is given to no man in perpetuity but to all mento eujoy
sor a time!

usu is probably a predicative dat, ‘for use’: if so, munce‘pio is the
same case: some regard both as ablatives of manner.
mancipium, ‘absolute ownership‚' is oiten opposed to urm, ‘tem-
porary enjoyment': cf. Hor. Epp. ii a, inu propriam aa qaae a&
libra mercatus et aerest, i qreuedom, si credis consultis. ”mim W
