Notus, ’ 103

1010. expleri...potestur: cf. i 1045 suppleri...queatur: in each
case the passive is due to the passive inf. which precedes: so, with
a passive int, coeptus sum and desitus sum are regularly used for coepi
lnd desii.

' 1011. After this 1. Munro marks a lacuna for two reasons: (1) the
subjects have uo verb; (a) it is strange that Ixion's wheel should be
omitted in au enumeration of this kind; and we know from Servius
(on Virg. Aen. vi 596) that he did find Ixion mentioned iu this passage,
and compared to traders who risk their lives at sea, Consequently
some verses have been lost.

(Logically‚ Ixion ought to come after the Danaids and before Cerberus

¹ and the F uries, as he is a type aud not merely a terror. It is possible
that there is a lacuna of several 11. after 1010, and of one 1. after 1011:
so Giussani.)

1012. aestua, ‘fires’: hell is represented as a sort of volcano in .
popular belief.

legendary terrors mentioued in the lost verses.

¹0²3· ‘Here, on earth, in short, the life of fools becomes a hell‘:
for this meaning of blo, cf. 1. 992.

The names that follow reach a climax in the mention of Epi-
cu1usr first come kiugs and generals, theu poets and philosophers then
Democritus and last the greatest of all philosophers.

1024. tute: the suffix seems to be used with no obser pressum
the plur. 1's uosmet. Lucr. also uses tutemet.
